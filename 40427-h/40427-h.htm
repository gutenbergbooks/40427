<p class="references">The Joint Standing Committee of 1866 on the Hoosac Tunnel
and the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, authorized to visit the
tunnel and railroad, examine into the condition and progress
of the work, and to report fully the result of such examination
respectfully</p>


<p class="center">REPORT:</p>

<p>That since the adjournment of the legislature the Committee
in a body visited the tunnel and railroad in June, and again in
October, and they continued their examination of the condition
and progress of the work by sub-committees in the months of
July, August, September, November and December; (one of
the examinations being exclusively devoted to the operations on
the railroad which were commenced late in October;) the others
to the tunnel and the various structures and mechanical operations
connected therewith, including an examination of the
existing contracts, and an inquiry into the general organization
adopted to carry out the laws and purposes of the State in
regard to the enterprise.</p>

<p>The Committee have also examined the records and the
doings of the directors of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad
from the organization of the corporation until the surrender of
the railroad to the State, and have made extracts from the
records to show the financial condition of the corporation, its
dealings with the contractors for constructing the road and
tunnel, and also the embarrassed condition of the contractors
and corporation from 1855 to 1861, which finally led to the
practical abandonment of the contract on the part of Messrs.
H. Haupt &amp; Company, and the surrender of the road to the
State under the mortgages which had been given to secure the
loan advanced by the Commonwealth in aid of the road and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tunnel. These extracts from the records, with extracts from
some of the laws passed upon the subject of the railroad and
tunnel, together with remarks of the Committee upon the
legislation of the State, the doings of the directors, and their
efforts and those of the contractors to prosecute the enterprise
being too long for the body of this Report, will be found in the
Appendix at A. And a synopsis of the action and condition
of the corporation at the time of, and previous to the surrender
of the road, and the relation of the contractors to the corporation
and to the State, will be stated before entering upon the
particular description of the condition and progress of the
work the present year, as observed by the Committee.</p>

<p>The charter of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad was granted
in 1848, authorizing the construction of a railroad from a
"point on the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, at or near
Greenfield," to the line of the States of New York or Vermont,
to connect with any railroad that might be constructed from
or near the city of Troy in New York. Its capital stock was
limited to $3,500,000. Authority was given in the charter to
contract with any contiguous railroad leading from either of
the above-named States, for the use of the same or any part
thereof, or for operating the two roads conjointly, or for hiring
such other railroad, or for letting their own railroad to the
owners of any other road which should compose a part of the
railroad line between Troy and Boston, of which the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad should be a part.</p>

<p>The corporation was organized June 1, 1848. April 11,
1849, the directors voted an assessment of three per cent. upon
its capital stock, and this assessment was the only one that was
substantially collected, and on the first day of October, in the
same year, they voted to put the construction of the road under
contract as soon as sufficient subscription should be obtained
therefore, commencing at Pownal, Vermont, and Greenfield. In
January, 1850, $2,203.94 had been received into the treasury,
and $2,203.57 had been expended with the approbation of the
president of the corporation, leaving in the treasurer's hand
$0.37.</p>

<p>Sundry assessments was voted from time to, time, the last
vote being in May, 1852, amounting in all to 75 per cent. upon
the subscriptions, but they were rescinded in July, 1858, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
new series of assessments were afterwards made which the Committee
understand were as unproductive of beneficial results as
were the former, upon which only partial payments had been
made by a portion of the subscribers.</p>

<p>A contract for constructing the road was made with Messrs.
Gilman and Carpenter in October, 1850. At the close of the
year 1850, stock to the amount of $250,800 had been subscribed,
of which $72,000 was payable in land damages, and
$50,000 was taken by the contractors.</p>

<p>At this period in the history of the corporation, with $138,800
of available cash subscription, of which three per cent. had
been paid, the corporation applied to the State for aid by a loan
to enable it to prosecute the enterprise it had assumed, and this
application was continued without success until 1854, when the
legislature passed the Act authorizing a loan of $2,000,000,
upon conditions which are particularly set forth in the Loan
Act, (see Appendix A and B,) which, modified by subsequent
legislation, discloses the policy of the State in granting its
assistance to the undertaking.</p>

<p>It is proper to state, that at the time this loan was granted,
there was no prospect of opening this line of travel by individual
efforts, and the amount of the loan, taking into consideration
the then assumed estimates of its probable cost, shows
that the State assumed to defray the cost of an enterprise to
the completion of which available individual means had proved
inadequate.</p>

<p>In 1855, a contract for the construction of the road and
tunnel was made with E. W. Serrell. The capital stock of the
corporation was fixed at $1,500,000. This contract was changed
two or three times, and finally ended in one executed by H.
Haupt and Henry Cartwright. For an account of these
changes, and of the votes and transactions of the directors and
the contractors, reference is made to Appendix A, where the
same will be found in detail.</p>

<p>Upon a careful examination of these votes and transactions,
the Committee come to the conclusion that the financial embarrassments
of the corporation from the year 1855, when the first
contract with E. W. Serrell was made to the time of the suspension
of the works under the last contract with H. Haupt &amp;
Co., are apparent. And it is also apparent that during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
same time, the contractors assumed, to a very great extent, the
control and responsibility of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Under the first contract, and on the day of its acceptance,
the direction of the engineering operations within the tunnel
was left with the contractor; excepting measuring for estimates
and the final acceptance of the work; and on his subscribing
$600,000 to the capital stock, $800,000 (less the new subscriptions,)
was added to the contract prices for the work.</p>

<p>Under the second contract with Serrell, Haupt &amp; Co., the
directors voted to substitute bonds for stock in payment of the
work until 2,000 feet of the tunnel was completed, and to pay
the discounts and losses to which the contractors might be
required to submit, not exceeding fifteen per cent. per annum;
and also, to issue to the contractors bonds to the amount of
$100,000 in addition to payments. Said bonds were to be sold
or pledged by Haupt &amp; Co., to enable them to raise means to
carry on their operations under the contract.</p>

<p>On the dissolution of the firm of Serrell, Haupt &amp; Co., in
July 1856, Serrell resigned his office as director and was chosen
consulting engineer. At the same time, W. A. Galbraith, one
of the contractors in the following contract, was chosen a
director. Thereupon a new contract was made with H. Haupt,
W. A. Galbraith, C. B. Duncan and Henry Cartwright. Under
this contract the estimates were to be made by the company's
engineer. In July, 1857, the records show that no payments
had been made the contractors for more than a year, and that
the work could be carried on only by the continued efforts and
personal credit of the contractors.</p>

<p>In February, 1858, the contract was again changed, and
Messrs. Haupt and Cartwright engaged with the corporation to
complete the road and tunnel. At this time, the records show
that no payments had been made under the previous contracts
"for more than two years; that the work could only be carried
on by the continued efforts, increased expenditures, and personal
credit of the contractors."</p>

<p>By a provision of this contract, any revenue arising from the
use of the road, or any portion of it, was assigned to the contractors
until their claims upon the company were adjusted;
and the payment of all the company's debts was to be deferred
until that of the contractors was satisfied; and Haupt &amp; Co.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
agreed to maintain the organization of the corporation, pay its
bills for printing, and advance therefore a sum not less than
$500,000.</p>

<p>The same year the Rensselaer Iron Company was allowed a
lien on the iron delivered to the contractors until the same was
paid for. In 1859, H. Haupt relinquished his pecuniary interest
in the contract, and was appointed chief engineer of the
corporation. (See Appendix A, page 62.) These transactions
in which the contractors participated, (one of whom was on the
board of directors,) show conclusively that they were fully
apprized of the condition of the corporation, from the date of
their first connection with the work to the time of its "suspension,"
no claim during the whole period having been made
by them against the Commonwealth for any work done for the
corporation.</p>

<p>The existence of the mortgages to the State were of course
well known to the contractors. They were given in pursuance
of laws passed by the legislature, and for security of the payments
received by the contractors for their services. The right
of the Commonwealth to take possession of the railroad under
the mortgages, must have been well understood. Further, the
corporation, in surrendering the road to the State, did no injury
to the contractors, for the act of surrender did not take place
until after the contractors had suspended work upon both road
and tunnel, and practically abandoned the enterprise; thus
leaving to the State the alternative, either to take possession of
the work and complete the road and tunnel, or to abandon it;
and, in addition to the loss of the advances already made,
forego the anticipated benefits of an additional avenue for
Western traffic.</p>

<p>The treasurer's books do not show any settlement between
Haupt and Company and the corporation. The account standing
upon the ledger shows a large balance against the contractors;
but the Committee are informed that subsequent to May 30,
1863, a settlement was made upon the basis of Mr. Stevenson's
report (see Appendix A,) and that Mr. Haupt received, in conformity
with the contract of H. Haupt &amp; Co. with the Troy and
Greenfield corporation, payment for all labor done and material
furnished by said H. Haupt &amp; Co., for the corporation, and that
all matters between the parties have been adjusted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Although the accounts between the contractors and the
corporation are understood to be settled, it may be interesting
to examine the account of the Commonwealth with the enterprise
and compare the value of the work done by the contractors
at the time of its abandonment by them, with the payments
made to them therefore, from the treasury of the State.</p>

<p>From the foregoing statement it appears that the contractors
with the Troy and Greenfield Railroad corporation, have
received from the State, three hundred and nineteen thousand
nine hundred and thirty-six dollars and eighty-two cents more
than the value of the work which the corporation surrendered
under the mortgage, and that the State has lost that amount of
money in its efforts to assist in the construction of the work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
It is proper to add as the judgment of the very intelligent
chairman of the commissioners (Mr. J. W. Brooks,) from
whose statement to the Committee the foregoing figures are
taken, that the loss to the State in the transaction by the failure
of Messrs. B. Haupt &amp; Co., to perform their contract in a
proper manner, will reach the sum of three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. (See statement, Appendix C.)</p>

<p>The Commonwealth having taken possession of the road and
tunnel, and by the legislation of 1862 and 1863 undertaken
their construction with the free consent of the corporation, the
directors by an appropriate vote, expressed their concurrence
with the proceeding, and their reliance upon the "good faith of
the legislature" to complete the enterprise which had exhausted
the resources of its immediate projectors. The last act of the
corporation, as appears by the records, was the choice of officers
in August, 1865, when Alvah Crocker was chosen president and
Wendell T. Davis, clerk and treasurer.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Description of the Tunnel.</span></p>

<p>The tunnel enters the eastern side of the Hoosac Mountain,
in the town of Florida, a few rods from the right bank of the
Deerfield River. The eastern summit of the mountain is 2,210
feet above tide-water, 1,499 feet above the Deerfield River, 1,429
feet above the grade of the railroad, and is distant from the East
Portal of the tunnel 6,100 feet. The western summit is 2,510
feet above tide-water 1,788 feet above the Hoosac River, 1,718
feet above the grade of the railroad, and 6,700 feet distant from
the West Portal. Each portal of the tunnel is 766 feet above
tide-water. The summits are 2<sup>41</sup>/<sub>100</sub> miles distant from each
other, and the valley between them at its lowest depression is
801 feet above the grade of the railroad.</p>

<p>The length of the tunnel, from the East End to the West End,
as commenced by Mr. Haupt, is 4<sup>84</sup>/<sub>100</sub> miles. Its base is, at
the East End, 70 feet above the Deerfield River, and at the West
End, 70 feet above the Hoosac River. Its grade, from the East
End to the Central Shaft, is 18 feet per mile; from the West
End to West Shaft, 26<sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> feet per mile; and from the West Shaft
towards the Central Shaft, 21<sup>12</sup>/<sub>100</sub> feet per mile. These grades
are calculated to allow the free passage of water from the
centre. Should the quantity of water found in the tunnel render
feasible a reduction of this grade, a change is contemplated.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the tunnel areas follows: The rock
cutting is 24 feet high and 24 feet wide. The brick-work is 26
feet high and 26 feet wide. The bottom of the tunnel will
contain a culvert three feet deep at the centre. Through this
culvert the water from the tunnel is to be discharged. It now
receives, in addition to the water accumulating in the tunnel,
a 12-inch pipe, to carry air at a low pressure for ventilation;
an 8-inch pipe to carry air for driving the drilling machines;
and a 3-inch pipe for carrying water for use in the holes which
are being drilled. Should it be found advisable to use gas in
carrying on the work, provision is made for a 4-inch pipe to
carry the gas from the place of manufacture. The track is to
be placed 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet above the bottom
of the rock tunnel, and 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
feet above the bottom, where lined with brick.</p>

<p>The distance by the highway, from the town of North Adams,
or from the West End to the East End of the tunnel, is about
nine miles. From the first named points to the Central Shaft is
about five miles, and from the Central Shaft to the East End
the distance is six miles.</p>

<p>The time necessary to travel from the West End to the East
End, is two hours. Loaded teams from either end to the other
perform the distance and return in a day.</p>

<p>The above were contained on the engineer's pay-roll.</p>

<p>Since the first visit of the Committee to the tunnel, many
important changes have been made in the force above mentioned,
to wit: The salary of the chief engineer was reduced
to $3,600, he to provide his transportation to various points
upon the work. One of the assistant engineers resigned and
retired, and the office of two of them has been abolished. The
salary of the superintendent has been increased to $3,000.
The office of freight clerk has been abolished, and its duties
transferred to that of paymaster and cashier. The salaries
of store-keepers and their assistants were not a charge to the
State, but were paid from the profit of their respective stores.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the work, it was deemed necessary
to provide stores at the three points where the operations were
carried on, to supply the workmen readily with necessaries, so
that no time might be lost by them in the important duty of
making provision for their families. But in the present state
of the enterprise, it is probable that private individuals would
readily establish such stores, and relieve the State from a duty
which, although it involved no pecuniary charge, diverted to
some extent the attention of officers from their more legitimate
avocations.</p>

<p class="pmt2">Of this list the foreman of the brickyard is a temporary
appointment. The foreman of carpenters at the West End has
finished his work and retired. The foreman of masons was
discharged by the commissioners, and has entered into the
employ of Mr. Farren at the West End.</p>

<p>There are nine foremen of the heading gangs, two of whom
have $100 per month, and the remainder $3.00 per day.</p>

<p>The heading gangs consist of eleven drillers each, including
the foreman, and from three to five rockmen for removing stone.
They work by shifts of eight hours, relieving each other at
8 A. M., 4 P. M., and 12, midnight. The blasts are made about
the time of relief. The men working on the enlargement under
private contractors make two shifts a day, each shift working
ten hours. The Committee made a special examination of the
number of men employed under the engineer and superintendent,
with a view of considering whether the force actually
engaged was necessary to an economical prosecution of the
enterprise, intending to suggest any reform that might
occur to them as essential; but learning that the engineer
would in the course of the year make some reduction in the
number of the men as well as of the teams employed upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
work, the Committee deferred taking up the subject until
the anticipated reductions should have been made. And now
understanding that the commissioners have the whole matter
under consideration, and that they have already to some extent,
acted thereon, the Committee for reasons that would be
obvious, withhold any recommendations or remarks upon this
point.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">System of Operations.</span></p>

<p>The general superintendence of the labor on the work is
vested in Mr. Hill. The reports are made to the engineer.

<p>The materials furnished for the construction of the work are
charged in their distribution to twenty-three accounts, as will
be seen by the tabular statement of its cost. Requisitions for
materials are signed by the immediate overseer, captain or
foreman; they are handed to the superintendent for approval,
and by him forwarded to the engineer. If the requisition is
approved by both, the materials are ordered, and when furnished
the applicant signs upon a duplicate his receipt for the same.
This course is pursued as well for materials taken from the
State lands as for those purchased. Suitable blanks for returns,
requisitions, &amp;c., are furnished to the several points, and the
evidence of all the transactions is preserved in the office of the
engineer. In addition to the above, a return of all material
broken, or laid aside, is made to the engineer, at whose office
a substantial account of all materials on hand, either in use, or
out of use, may be found.</p>

<p>The organization of the working force, and the mode adopted
for supplies and expenditures at the various points, appear
well adapted to an efficient and economical prosecution of the
enterprise.</p>


<p class="caption2 smcap">Divisions of the Work.</p>

<p class="caption3sc">East End.</p>

<p><i>Deerfield Dam.</i>&mdash;This structure is completed. Flashboards
to be used in low stages of water may have to be occasionally
renewed.</p>

<p>The canal is finished as far as wheelpit No. 3. The machine-shop
is about 72 feet long, and 36 feet wide. It has three turbine
wheels. A fourth wheel is designed, but is not required
at the present time, and the pit to receive it is not completed.</p>

<p>In the basement of the machine-shop are two compressors.
The first was put in January, 1866. It has four cylinders 13
inches in diameter, and 20 inches stroke. This compressor is
used to drive the drills, and furnish air for the blacksmith
shop. The second compressor was put in some time in October. It
has four cylinders 25 inches in diameter, and 24 inches stroke,
and is used for ventilation one-fourth of the time, two hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
after each blast, viz., from 8 to 10, A. M., from 4 to 6, P. M.,
and from 12 to 2, A. M. The compressors work satisfactorily.
The loss of power in the transmission of air from the machine-shop
to the drills, a distance of 4,500 feet, being hardly perceptible.</p>

<p>In addition to the compressors, there is in the machine-shop
the following machinery, viz.: three lathes, one of them worked
by hand; a drilling machine; a planer; a bolt-cutting machine
and a saw-table. Sixty horse-power is required to carry the
machine-drills, the machines in the shop, and to furnish air for
the blacksmith shop. When the large compressor is used, 75
additional horse-power is required. A circular saw at the east
end of the machine shop, is occasionally used, driven by power
derived from the turbine wheels.</p>

<p>The blacksmith shop, near the entrance of the tunnel, contains
three forges. The hand-drills are made, and, together with
the machine drills, sharpened at this shop. The ordinary
repairs of the drilling machines are done in the machine shop.
New parts of the same are furnished from Fitchburg.</p>

<p>The heading in the tunnel at this end when driven by hand
was about 15 feet wide by 6 feet high. When driven by the
machines it is 16 feet wide and 8 feet high. Its location is in
the centre of the tunnel, 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet above
subgrade, and 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet
above the road bed.</p>

<p>The progress of the excavations at the East End heading for
the year ending December, 1866, has been 569 feet; at the rate
of 47.42 per month.</p>

<p>The progress during the six months ending May, 1866, was
338 feet; an average per month of 56 feet 4 inches. One
week was lost in June in introducing the machine-drills, in consequence
of which the progress that month was reduced to 50 feet
6 inches. During the five months ending November 30, the progress
has been 219<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet; being an average of 43.9 feet per
month. It will be seen by the table, that in July, the first
month after the introduction of the drill machines, the progress
attained was only 26.5 feet. As the men became better
acquainted with them, the progress was increased to 48 feet in
August, and in September it rose to 54.5, having nearly attained
the average progress of the six months preceding their introduction.
Had there been an adequate supply, there can be
little doubt that the progress would have continued to increase,
and would have shown the superiority of the machine-drill
over hand-labor; but the supply fell off, and the progress in
October was reduced to 34 feet and 6 inches.</p>

shop, a saw-mill, powder-house, gas-house, ash-house,
wood-shed, and a barn; and in connection with the work, a
store, a boarding-house, the Thacher farm-house and out-buildings,
4 first-class and 7 common shanties. The cost of buildings
at the Central Shaft in July, 1866, was $11,080.13. The
cost in November, 1866, was $12,026.83. The annual rent of
that portion leased to operatives is $736.</p>

<p>A farm, containing 250 acres of land, with a dwelling-house
and barn, has been purchased, adjoining the Central Shaft, for
the sum of $3,000. The land was well covered with timber,
about one-half of which has been cut for the purposes of the shaft
and tunnel. There is estimated to be one million feet of hemlock
timber still standing, which will be wanted in the progress
of the work. This purchase was an advantageous one for the
State, there having been already realized from it an amount
equal to its cost.</p>

<p>On the first day of November there were employed at this
point, in all, 81. Of this number, 40 were engaged out of the
shaft, and 41 in the shaft.</p>

<p>The above enumeration does not include the resident engineer
and time-keeper, stationed here in November.</p>

<p>The depth of Central Shaft, when completed, will be 1,037
feet from the surface; its form is an ellipse, whose axes are 27
and 15 feet. On the fifth day of May it had reached the
depth of 300.5 feet. At this time the hoisting apparatus was
removed from the shaft, and the work of excavation ceased.
The new hoisting apparatus was fitted on the first day of
August, and the drilling commenced at midnight on that day.</p>

<p>Previous to the change in the hoisting apparatus, the monthly
progress had averaged about 18<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet per month. The
advance in October and November was 46 feet; the gain over
the previous rate of progress is attributable to the practice
of simultaneous blasting.</p>

<p>On the first day of January, 1867, the shaft had been sunk
393 feet, leaving for excavation 644 feet.</p>

 Work suspended to put in new hoisting apparatus.</p>

<p>The present hoisting apparatus is expected to be sufficient
to finish the shaft. It has two wire ropes, each 1,260 feet long.
The time for a round trip is seven minutes. The engine here
is of 100 horse-power. The blacksmith shop contains two
forges. At the small machine shop the repairs required here
are made, as also some repairs for the West Shaft.</p>

<p>The Central Shaft, though designed to aid in ventilating the
tunnel, was intended also to accelerate its construction by
affording to the process of excavation four faces instead of two
during some portion of the work; and the former chairman of
the commissioners expected by the aid of machine-drilling,
the shaft might be completed in one year from the time such
drilling should commence within it. In this anticipation, ten
vertical drilling machines were constructed to work in the
shaft area and a compressor with two cylinders was provided to
furnish the power for operating them. The want of drilling
machines at the East End became so urgent, that these vertical
ones were changed to horizontals, and used at that point, and
the sinking of the shaft by hand-drilling still continues. But
if the experiments now in progress at the East End with the
new drilling machine shall demonstrate its superiority over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hand labor, the machine will doubtless be introduced into the
shaft.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">West Shaft.</p>

<p>This shaft has an area of about 8 by 13 feet, and was excavated
by Messrs. H. Haupt &amp; Co. Its depth is 316 feet.</p>

<p>The buildings here used by the State are the West Shaft
house, the New Shaft building, a blacksmith shop containing
two forges, a powder-house, a horse-shed, ash-house and tank-house.
The buildings owned by the State and leased to operatives
are a boarding-house and four old shanties built by H.
Haupt &amp; Co., four first-class shanties, eight common shanties,
and a double cottage. The buildings at the West End, are connected
on the books with those at the West Shaft, and will be here
enumerated. They consist of a carpenter's shop, time-keeper's
office, a blacksmith shop containing one forge, tool-house, powder-house,
horse-shed, brickyard shed, brickyard, engine-house,
artesian wells Nos. 3 and 4, buildings, and two-thirds of a
barn, which are occupied by the State. One boarding-house,
store, one-third of a barn, the Harrington farm-house, barn and
out-buildings, twenty-seven common shanties and brickyard
boarding shanty. These buildings, with part of blacksmith
shop, part of carpenter's shop and time-keeper's office, are
rented to operatives and to Mr. Farren, the contractor for
constructing the brick arch.</p>

a diameter of 13 inches and 24 inches stroke. The West
heading from this shaft was advanced 293 feet, and the East
heading 1,042, on the first day of December, 1866. The
progress for the year ending November 1, 1866, at the heading at
this point was 636.7, being a fraction over 53 feet per month.
For the last four months, ending December 1, 1866, the progress
was 322.1, being a fraction over 64 feet per month, which exceeds
by four feet per month the highest estimate for hand-drilling
by the engineers in 1862, and by thirty and one-third feet the
estimate of Mr. Latrobe. The progress of the work at this
heading during the last six months, making allowance for the
influx of water in November, having exceeded the highest estimate
for hand-drilling, should be regarded as evidence alike of
the skill of the miners and the good management of the
engineer and his subordinates.</p>

<p>The West heading at this shaft was at first driven 6 feet by
11. It has been found advisable to enlarge it to the dimension
of 10 feet 6 inches by 15 feet. This work has been performed
by contract. The first letting was at the rate of four dollars
per cubic yard, the State furnishing the materials used and
removing the stone. The contractors at this rate could not
pay their expenses. It was raised to six dollars per yard which
was found not to pay, and in July the price was advanced to
seven dollars and fifty cents. The State pay the men, charging
the same to the contractors, and keep their time. Good progress
is made and the work is done to the satisfaction of the
engineer.</p>

<p>The East heading at this point was being enlarged also by
contract, from 6 feet by 15, to 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> by 15. The work commenced
on the 15th of July, 1866; the price paid is seven
dollars per cubic yard; the contractors load their own stone
and also that coming from the heading. The State provides
the materials used, and hoist the stone to the surface. While
the work of the miners at the East heading and of the contractors
upon both enlargements was progressing in a very satisfactory
mariner, the whole was arrested by an unexpected and
somewhat sudden influx of</p>


<p class="caption3sc">Water in the Tunnel.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November the miners working east from the
West Shaft struck a seam running across the stratification of
the mountain. Water soon issued from the seam at the rate of
twenty-three gallons per minute. On the 29th, the water had
risen at the foot of the shaft to two and a half feet above grade,
and the work was stopped. The usual speed of the engine
working the pump was forty-two revolutions per minute; it
was increased to fifty-six, and at that rate it succeeded in preventing
any further rise of the water. It became necessary to
increase the power of the pumps. The plunger was enlarged
from eight to ten inches, and a third lift pump was added. To
affect this arrangement the pumps were stopped from 9 o'clock,
A. M., December 7th, to 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> P. M. on the 8th. At this time the
water was four feet and eight inches above grade. On the 12th
the water was so much reduced that the miners recommenced
work. The next day, at 2 P. M., the water was struck in large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
quantities, the whole flow from the heading being 100 gallons
per minute. On the 14th, the work was again suspended, and
unsuccessful attempts made to stop the water by means of
wooden plugs driven into the seam. The pumps working with
the longest stroke and at increased speed, were just able to
keep the water from rising.</p>

<p>On the 19th, at 10.30 A. M., one of the trunnions of the
pump-bob broke, and seriously injured the pump gearing and
boxes. On the 21st a new trunnion was put in, and the pump
was attached to the small hoisting engine, the water now being
seven feet above grade. On the 28th, at noon, the breakages
being all repaired, the large engine was again attached to the
pumps, the water then being nine feet and eight inches above
grade. And, on the first day of January, at 4 P. M., the water
stood nine feet ten inches above grade at the foot of the
shaft.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> At
the time of the presentation of this Report, the Committee understood that the
water was entirely removed from the shaft and tunnel.</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3sc">The New Shaft.</p>

<p>This shaft is located about 264 feet westerly of the West
Shaft. Its dimensions are six feet by thirteen in the clear.
The rock to be removed from an area of eight feet by fifteen.
The labor is done by contract. The first price was $40 per
foot; increased July 1, 1866, to $50 per foot. The State furnishes
all the materials for construction, and the power to raise
the stone and water from the shaft. The depth of the shaft
will be 277 feet when open to grade. On the first day of
December, the miners working down had progressed 180 feet,
and those working from the tunnel up 45 feet. It was then
calculated that the shaft would be excavated in two months.
Plans for permanent pumps had been prepared; to furnish the
pumps according to the plans, would take several mouths. In
the meantime, a temporary pump was to be made at North
Adams, under the direction of the engineer.</p>

<p>On the first day of January, about thirty-eight feet of stone
remained for excavation in this shaft. The water in the tunnel
stopped the work from below, and the work is driven upon
one face only at the present time.</p>

<p>There are two small engines at this point, one of fourteen
and one of ten horse power. The pumps at this shaft, if constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
agreeably to the design of the engineer, will discharge
sixty-five gallons to a stroke and are to be worked by a bull
engine. The lift of the water will be eighty feet less than at
West Shaft, being discharged about 40 feet below the surface.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The West End.</p>

<p>The work at the West End of the tunnel is under contract.
Mr. B. N. Farren of Doylestown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania,
by an agreement dated May 1, 1866, contracted to put in a
stone and brick arch of the dimensions before stated, 26 feet by
26, for the following prices, viz.:&mdash;Earth excavation $3.50 per
yard; brick masonry, $12 per perch; stone masonry, $6 per
perch. Contractor planks the bottom and sides when necessary
at $15 per lineal foot. The State furnishes the bricks at
$9 per thousand and the timber at $16 per thousand for hemlock,
and $18 for spruce and hard-wood. The length of arch
contracted for is 174 feet, the whole of which is open. The
State also furnishes the cement, which costs in Troy, New York,
from $1.65 to $1.70 per barrel, to which is to be added the
freight at 30 cents per barrel. A barrel of cement is used for
a perch of masonry.</p>

<p>The contractor agrees to construct two hundred feet of under
ground tunnel, and as much more as he can before August 1,
1867, at the following prices, viz.:&mdash;Earth excavation at $6.50
per yard; brick masonry at $13 per perch; stone masonry at
$6.50 per perch. The timbering, from $40 to $50 per foot,
lineal, depending upon the thickness of the wall. He may,
under permission from the engineer, take stone and sand from
the State's premises, without making compensation.</p>

<p>Payments are to be made about the 12th of each month for
the work done the preceding month, at the rate of 80 per cent.
of the finished work.</p>

<p>The decision of the engineer as to the method, quality, quantity
and classification of the work to be final and conclusive.
In order to facilitate the progress of the work and with a due
regard to economy, the State has purchased the following lots
of land in the vicinity of the West End, to wit:&mdash;A wood lot,
containing sixty acres, at a cost of $9,900; the Harrington
Farm; 130 acres with the buildings, inclosing the West End
and West Shaft; and running half way up the mountain. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
purchase was made January 26, 1866, price $3,000. The
Kingsley lot, purchased March 16, 1866, at $2,793.87.</p>

<p>The timber used by Mr. Farren is obtained from these lots.
The tops of the trees are cut into wood and used at the brickyard.
About five hundred cords of wood has been cut on the
Harrington, and one thousand cords on the Kingsley lot, for
the use of the brickyard, and is now on hand.</p>

<p>The necessity of making the bricks required for the arch
tunnel is apparent. They could not be furnished by individuals
at North Adams. 120,000, before the yard at the West
End was fitted up, were purchased at Springfield at $9 per
thousand; the freight of which to North Adams was $6, and
the teaming to the West End $2 per thousand. If to these
prices be added the depreciation and waste from handling, the
cost will reach $18 for all that could be used in the work. It
is the opinion of the engineer and superintendent of labor, that
the bricks made by the State will cost less than $9 when delivered
to the contractor.</p>

<p>Mr. Farren began work under his contract June 7, 1866,
and early in December the brick-work at the top of the arch
had entered the mountain. The masonry was commenced
about, twenty-five feet west of the point first selected, so that
the open masonry will in fact be 200 feet long. About thirty
feet of invert is left uncovered the present season, under an
apprehension that the bricks on hand will only supply what will
be wanted in the drift, in order to prosecute the work with
dispatch. The invert has been properly protected, and its
preservation may be expected.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the invert and the sides to the spring of
the arch was laid with five courses of brick, and the arch with
six. The masonry has been strengthened to meet the effect of
the soft ground and increased pressure to eight bricks thick all
round. Where rocks are found, it will be reduced at the
bottom, and perhaps at the top.</p>

<p>The excavation of the drift is in progress and is carried on
with two galleries. The lower one is of timber, and is at the
bottom three feet below the grade of the road. This gallery is
ten feet wide and ten feet high.</p>

<p>The upper gallery, also of timber, is ten feet wide and four feet
high, and the space between the galleries is about ten feet. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the arch is driven in, the top of the invert is 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet below the
grade of the road, and 18 inches below the timber of the lower
gallery. The top timbers of the upper gallery constitute the
top timbers of the tunnel during the excavation. They are supported
above the masonry and the arch is turned under them.</p>

<p>Side drains, six feet high and four feet wide, are excavated
ahead of the galleries, to assist the drainage of the ground
through which the galleries and tunnel are driven. The water
from these drains is let into the tunnel through its sides, and
runs out with the general drainage upon the invert below the
road-bed. Holes are left in the invert at proper intervals to
facilitate this drainage.</p>

<p>The side drains are hereafter to be filled with stone, which
will constitute a blind drain, and also afford a proper support
to the masonry.</p>

<p>The work at this point is of difficult prosecution, but the
performance of the contract may be confidently expected.</p>

drying yard is 300 feet long and 120 feet wide. The kiln shed
is 300 feet long and 50 feet wide, and of capacity to burn all
the bricks that can be moulded. There are six brick machines,
four of which are in use. They are driven by an engine, and
used alternately, two each day. The making of bricks at the
yard commenced June 26 and closed October 24, 1860. About
1,700,000 bricks were made, of which 80 per cent. are sufficiently
hard for use in the tunnel, which is estimated to be
sufficient to complete the 374 feet of tunnel now under
contract.</p>

<p>The clay for the bricks is found near the yard, and hitherto
a sufficiency of sand has been found in the vicinity; but it is
less abundant than the clay.</p>

<p>In addition to the property enumerated under the preceding
heads, the State has at North Adams, a freight house, cashier's
office, engineer's office, stable and two coal sheds, and opposite
the West End on the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad, an
additional freight house. There are also two instrumental
station houses on the east and west summits respectively, all of
which are occupied by the State for the purposes of the enterprise.
There is also one seven-horse engine and three small
compressors. Tho State has also four mule teams, three of
four, and one of two animals, making fourteen in all. There
were also used on the work in the early part of the year, twelve
or fourteen horses, employed in hauling clay, sand, wood, &amp;c.
Six of these have been sold to Mr. Farren, and the remainder
are to be disposed of. To this enumeration should be added
five horses and three or more carriages kept at the stable at
North Adams for the transportation of the engineers, superintendent,
master mechanic, &amp;c., from point to point along the
line of operations wherever their presence and services might
be needed.</p>

<p>for the expense of keeping five horses, and the repairs; which
is about five dollars per week in all. The charge for keeping
horses at the stable in North Adams, is five dollars per week for
feed; and the cost for the use of one horse and wagon from North
Adams to the East End, is four dollars. These horses were
also used to transport the commissioners and the committee
visiting the tunnel, when required for that purpose.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The Road between the Tunnel and North Adams.</p>

<p>It is proposed to change the course of, the road as it emerges
from the tunnel, and two lines have been surveyed, which,
diverging near the approach cut, unite again about midway
from thence to the village. The difference in length is about
thirty feet. The northerly line is the least expensive to construct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and best favors the landholders on the route. It has
the recommendation of the engineer, and the approval of the
consulting engineer, and will probably be selected. There are
reasons for an early location of this portion of the road which
call for a prompt action in this behalf on the part of the
commissioners, which will undoubtedly be taken.</p>

<p class="caption3sc">Experiments.</p>

<p>The interest awakened by the magnitude of the undertaking
to tunnel the Hoosac Mountain, and the anxiety manifested for
its early completion, prompted the commissioners to the discovery
of means to accelerate the progress of the work. Their
attention was naturally directed to the operation of drilling,
and with a view of improving upon the machine drill used at
Mont Cenis; scientific mechanics have been employed to devise
and construct a drill that should attain that end.</p>

<p>As a first step Gouch's patent of the hollow piston-rod, was
purchased for New England, for the sum of five hundred
dollars. After which, a Mr. Gardner was employed to construct
a drill; but his efforts failed of success after an expenditure of
thirteen hundred dollars. A Mr. Butler was engaged to devise
a machine, but in the course of studying the subject, his health
failed and his services were lost.</p>

<p>A Mr. Hanson completed a machine which promised some
success; but on trial it proved a failure.</p>

<p>A second machine called the Brooks, Burleigh and Gates
drill, was made under the direction of the commissioners at
Fitchburg. This machine was put upon the works and used for
several months.</p>

<p>A third machine, called the Burleigh drill, an improvement
upon the preceding one, was next produced, which is now at
the works on the East Heading.</p>

<p>About $13,000 was spent upon these experiments, resulting
in the construction of the Brooks, Burleigh and Gates drill,
and the manufacture of four of them. About one-half of this
expenditure may be charged to these last drills; the other was
unproductive of anything of value.</p>

<p>The Brooks, Burleigh and Gates drill was patented, but the
Commonwealth has the right to use them in the construction of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>These machines will now be described.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The Hanson Machine.</p>

<p>This machine has a cylinder and valve motion, similar to a
steam-engine. The piston is hollow, the drill-bar which may
be of any required length, passing through it, is moved with
the piston, by means of four wedges or cams on each end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the piston; these cams are pressed on the drill-bar by means of
sliding collars forced upon them by a complex arrangement
operating alternately. The drill-bar is rotated by means of a
ratchet operated by a spiral groove in the shield of the machine.
The main difficulty in this machine was in the complex arrangement
for forcing the collars upon the cams or wedges. It did
not work well in a horizontal position. The machine consisted
of one hundred and twenty pieces, and weighed five hundred
and ninety-five pounds.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The Brooks, Burleigh and Gates Machine.</p>

<p>This machine has a hollow piston, the drill-holder being a
screw passing through the piston, moving with it, and fed
through it, by means of a nut on the end of the piston-rod.
This nut is held by means of a cap or union nut, as it is called,
the union nut being screwed on to the coupling, and the coupling
nut screwed to the piston-rod. The feed-nut protrudes
through the union nut, and is allowed to turn round in it. On
the end of this feed-nut is a ratchet gear covered by a ratchet-band
with an arm upon it, all moving with the piston. The
ratchet arm moves up and down in a spiral groove, the groove
being in a shield attached by screws to the cylinder; on the
ratchet-band there is a pall and two springs, one under the other.
One of the springs holds the pall in gear, the other holds it out
of gear. As the piston moves down, the outer spring comes in
contact with a trip which is on the shield and is lifted up,
allowing the under spring to throw the pall into the ratchet,
and as the piston is moved back, turns the nut round, thereby
feeding the screw forward. At the extremity of its backward
stroke, the pall comes in contact with another trip on the shield
which lifts it out of gear, the outer spring having a catch upon
it which holds the pall when thus lifted out. The rotary motion
is given by a ratchet on the coupling-nut, covered by a ratchet-band
the arm of which moves in a spiral groove in the shield
similar to the other, only having a spring to hold the pall in
the ratchet; this rotates all the parts on the piston except the
ratchet-bands and cross-head. The latter is held between two
check-nuts on the coupling-nut. To this cross-head is attached
a bar which communicates with a valve which opens the port
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
when the piston moves back, and shuts it when it moves forward;
the air is always on during its backward stroke. The
piston having a greater area on the forward than on the backward
stroke, overcomes the backward pressure and moves the
piston ahead, and when cut off, the continued pressure forces
the piston back.</p>

<p>This machine is automatic; generally running until some
portion of it is destroyed. No part of the machine has been
found strong enough to withstand the friction upon it for any
considerable portion of time. The union nut has proved its
weakest point, and the breaking of this generally destroys that
part of the piston to which it is attached. Another point of
weakness is the feed ratchet-band, the springs of which are
almost continually breaking.</p>

<p>The machine consists of eighty pieces; twenty-three of which
are screws, fifteen pins, and seven pieces of cast iron. It
weighs 240 pounds, runs about 200 strokes per minute,
and costs about $400. Its longest run without breaking has
been five days. The run of one of them two days without
breaking during the time, is considered fortunate. The average
breaking is more than one a day. A table showing the list
of breakages will follow this description.</p>

<p>The piston-head of this machine has a diameter of 4<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches.
The diameter of the piston-rod is 4 inches at the large end and
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> at the small end.</p>

<p>So there are 12<sup>87</sup>/<sub>100</sub> square inches of air area to drive the
drill ahead into the rock, and 4<sup>23</sup>/<sub>100</sub> to draw it out; but as the
air is not taken off from the front end, the actual pressure is
upon an area of the difference between the two, or 8<sup>64</sup>/<sub>100</sub> square
inches.</p>

<p>About forty of the Brooks, Burleigh and Gates machines
have been used at the tunnel; of these eight or ten were originally
vertical, and intended for use at the Central Shaft. At the
commencement of their use, the machines were new and had their
best wear in them; there were from twenty to twenty-four
at the beginning. In a short time they began to break down,
but by putting on a large repair force and converting the vertical
machines into horizontal ones, a fair supply was kept up for
from two to three months, at the end of which time the greatest
machine progress was attained, viz., fifty-four feet and six inches,
in September. After that the progress diminished very much,
and in proportion to the giving out of the machines. It is the
opinion of the engineer that if a constant supply of machines
could have been furnished, that the progress would have
reached a point much beyond that obtained by hand labor; but
with the stoppage of the supply, the number of machines that
could be kept in working order was daily reduced, and at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
it fell down to two or three, and finally, at times, none were in
condition to work. The frames were, however, kept in the
tunnel to await the completion of the Burleigh machine, the
reception of which was retarded till late in October; much
beyond the time anticipated by the commissioners, although the
work of their construction was carried on continuously night
and day. They came at intervals of several weeks, two at a
time; the first of which were put into the tunnel on the thirty-first
day of October. Through the month of December, four
of these machines were at work.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The Burleigh Machine.</p>

<p>Has a solid piston (so called,) which has a hole in its back
end to allow the feed-screw to pass in without touching; the
drill is secured to this piston. On the back end of the piston
is a section of a ball used as a cam, which works the valve and
the feed-motion. The valve is rotated by a rod lying on the
band of the cylinder; upon this rod are two cams which perforate
the band of the cylinder. The action of the piston brings
the ball on its end in contact with these cams, rocking them up
and down; the rod to which they are secured being connected
with the valve, imparts to that its motion. This machine is fed
altogether on ways, or a bed-piece, upon which is the feed-screw;
the feed-nut is upon the end of the cylinder-band. To this
feed-nut is attached a feed-ratchet, which is held between two
collars, allowing it to turn round. Upon the cylinder-band is
a lever, one end of which passes through the band; upon the
other end is a pall. The motion of the piston raises the lever
up, pressing the end containing the pall against the ratchet
which turns the nut on the feed-screw, thus moving the machine
forward. The rotating ratchet is in the band of the cylinder
and has a spline in it, and a pall on its outside. The piston
having a spiral groove is turned by this ratchet as it moves
down. On the return of the piston, the pall drops into the
ratchet and then the piston is turned. The piston is not
encumbered with any machinery, and moves alone; its area of
air is greater on the forward than on the backward stroke; the
alternation of the valve admits the air. The machine, like the
one last described, contains eighty pieces; it has the same number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of screws and pins, and weighs 372 pounds including the
ways or bed-piece; without the ways its weight is 212 pounds.
Its number of strokes is about 300 per minute, and its blow
somewhat lighter than that of the other. This machine is not
entirely automatic; the feed-motion not working regular;
when it does not, it is fed by hand, which is a simple process.</p>

<p>These machines stand the work much better than those first
made at Fitchburg. Their average time in the tunnel without
repairs in the interval, is about five days; they have needed
repairs in two days; one remained at work fourteen days.
They accomplish double the work without repairs that those do
which were made after the previous pattern. There is a further
advantage in using the Burleigh machines; their breaking,
when it occurs, is not very serious, the injured parts consisting
mainly of cams, can generally be replaced at the tunnel;
whereas for the repairs on the Brooks, Burleigh and Gates
machine, the dependence to a very great extent has been upon
the machine shop at Fitchburg.</p>

<p>The piston-head of this machine has a diameter of 4<sup>25</sup>/<sub>100</sub>
inches. The diameter of the piston-rod is at the large end, 3
inches, at the small end, 2<sup>75</sup>/<sub>100</sub> inches.</p>

<p>So the number of inches of air area, is 8<sup>20</sup>/<sub>800</sub> when the drill
is propelled upon the rock, and 7<sup>7</sup>/<sub>100</sub> when returning from it.</p>

<p>A full complement of men to work the machines first used,
would be, perhaps, thirteen. Mr. Gates, who superintended
their operation in the first instance, began with fourteen, but
they were reduced to thirteen. The Burleigh machine practically
requires feeding, and a full set at work would probably
demand fifteen men for their successful operation.</p>

<p>The value of these machines has not yet been ascertained.
The Committee are of opinion that when a full complement
shall have been obtained, so that the workmen can have at all
times a full supply upon the frames, that greater progress can
be obtained by them than by hand drilling; and after a few
months operation, the cost of using them, in comparison with
hand labor, can be fairly tested. But as the Brooks, Burleigh
and Gates machine has been abandoned, no useful results would
be obtained by comparing the expenses within the tunnel during
the months of July, August and September, with three corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
months when hand drilling was carried on, and no
satisfactory comparison can be made between the working of
the Burleigh machine and hand drilling, until a sufficient number
of machines has been introduced into the tunnel to keep
the men fully employed. It is to be hoped that machines sufficient
to make the test may be soon obtained, and that this
desirable information may be made known.</p>

<p>The introduction of the first machine into the tunnel, before
its capacity, strength, and expense of working had been fully
tested, was unfortunate, inasmuch as its use there delayed the
progress of the work. The second machine gives such promise
of success, that it will be continued in use in the tunnel until a
fair test has been made. But should the Burleigh machine
prove unsuccessful, and further attempts with machines be
attempted, the Committee recommend that their usefulness be
tested outside of the tunnel, and meanwhile the excavation
with hand drills be resumed.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">Experiments with Dr. Ehrhardt's Powder.</p>

<p>The first blast was fired in the tunnel at the East End on the
20th of November, but owing to the presence of charcoal or
some other substance in the article, a poisonous gas was
evolved which effected the miners disagreeably, and drove them
from the work. The subsequent experiments at this point were
not satisfactory, and were discontinued, and subsequently
resumed at the Central Shaft, where it was used most of the
time for a week, varying its composition from time to time. At
the close of the week, while preparing for the last blast, a premature
explosion took place, resulting in the death of one of
the miners, and the injury of three or four others.</p>

<p>The material result of this experiment was as follows:&mdash;With
261 days' work and 139<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lbs. of powder, 202 buckets of
stone were removed; while in the preceding week, using common
powder (schaghticoke) with 251<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> days' labor and 236
lbs. of powder, 168 buckets of stone were taken out. The cost
of the experimental powder is about twice as expensive as the
common powder, and its superior strength is apparent from the
above result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3sc">Experiments with Nitro-Glycerine.</p>

<p>During the summer, some experiments have been made with
this explosive agent. A quantity, costing $934.29, was
brought to the works by Colonel Schaffner, who exhibited the
action of the material in various ways, with a view of testing
its power, and the comparative safety of introducing it instead
of powder. After repeated trials outside of the works, during
which about three-fifths of the material was consumed, it was
introduced into the tunnel at the West Shaft with the following
result: It was used for three days at the East heading of
the West Shaft; the advance made in the heading was for the
time, 14<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet;&mdash;being an advance of 4.82 feet per day, and at
the rate of 125.33 feet per month.</p>

<p>The progress made at the West Shaft on the East heading
the present year, ending December 31, 1866, is 626 feet and 8
inches. This progress was somewhat lessened by the influx of
water in December. The monthly advance has been 52 feet
and 2 inches. The average of the eleven months ending with
November is 53 feet and 6 inches. Assuming the progress
made with glycerine during the three days of its use to be
obtainable throughout the year, the monthly progress, using that
material, would be 120 feet and 10 inches, on a calculation of
twenty-five days to a month, which would give an annual
advance of 1,450 feet.</p>

<p>Without vouching for results so favorable to the progress of
the work, it is impossible to overlook the importance of the
experiment; and the Committee are of opinion that this material,
if it can be procured, should be introduced into the tunnel
and shafts, and a thorough experiment made, in order to determine
whether it can be used with an advantage even approximating
to that shown by the first trial.</p>

<p>Experience has proved that the rock at the Hoosac Mountain
is of a peculiar character: comparatively easy to drill, but
extremely hard to displace, and that its advantageous excavation
requires a strong explosive agent. The difference in the
use of weak and strong powder is at once observed, and the
effect of simultaneous blasting, by the aid of electricity, is
proved by the increased progress of the work since it has been
used. It would seem evident, then, without the aid of experiment,
that an explosive agent, possessing eight times the power
of common powder, would be a valuable auxiliary to this
undertaking; and that if such an one could be obtained, and
safely used, no time should be lost in procuring a supply.</p>

<p>The use of nitro-glycerine in England is not uncommon; its
components are well known; and the Committee are informed
that it might be advantageously manufactured at any point
where it is used.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">Electrical Firing.</p>

<p>The experiment of simultaneous blasting by electricity has
been made with admitted success. The increased progress in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the Central Shaft from an average of about 18<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 23 feet per
month, demonstrates its utility, and will undoubtedly insure
the continuance of that mode of firing in preference to the
method formerly practised.</p>


<p class="caption3sc">The Troy and Greenfield Railroad.</p>

<p>The completion of the railroad from Greenfield to the tunnel
has been contracted for with B. N. Farren, for the sum of
$545,000, exclusive of the cost of depot buildings, turn-tables,
and engineering expenses. The road to be opened for travel
to Shelburne Falls by the 15th of November, 1867, and to the
tunnel by the 15th of July, 1868. A lease of the same has
been executed to the Fitchburg and the Vermont and Massachusetts
Railroad Companies, at a rent of $30,000 per year, to
expire on the completion of the tunnel, or whenever the work
on the same shall be stopped, by competent authority.</p>

<p>Mr. Farren commenced work under his contract about the
20th of October. At this time there were about four miles of
track,&mdash;exclusive of that which had to be removed with the
trestle-bridges,&mdash;built by Mr. Haupt. Some portions of the
track were in fair condition; but the larger part of it must be
relaid. Many of the ties are of hemlock; they are all decayed
and must be removed, and new ones substituted. None of the
bridges were strong enough to be used, and the timber of
which they were constructed is too much decayed to be used
for building purposes: There is on hand in addition to the
track laid, chairs, or connecting joints, sufficient to lay five
miles of rails; also about ten thousand chestnut ties. Such of
these as had been properly piled are sound. Many of them,
however, are so much decayed, as to be unfit for use.</p>

<p>The road-bed has in many places been injured by rain and
frost. At exposed points near the river, it is entirely destroyed.
Comparatively speaking, there was little masonry on the line.
With the exception of one pier, the bridge masonry at Green
River will be taken down. All the deep ravines were crossed
by trestle work, and consequently there were but few culverts.
Of these some small ones are still standing in good
condition. Of the bank wall built, about one-half remains,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
remainder has either fallen down, or will be taken down
and rebuilt.</p>

<p>Very little alteration will be made in the general location of
the line or its gradients. The curvature will be very much
modified and improved. Some sharp and reversed curves will
be entirely saved by the substitution of straight lines. Others,
where the expense of reduction is not very heavy, will be materially
changed. The alterations below Shelburne Falls are
substantially as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The same plan for improving the line above the falls will
be pursued, so that when completed, the road combining
the alignment with the gradients will, in the judgment of
the engineer, be "superior for doing economically a heavy
traffic, to any railroad in New England which runs east and
west."</p>

<p>At Green River there will be substituted for Mr. Haupt's
bridge of 700 feet built on a curved line one of 470 feet, to be
constructed on a straight line. The remainder of the ravine
to be made a solid embankment. All the bridges on the line
are to be "Howe's Truss," and equal in strength and durability
to any in New England.</p>

<p>The trestle-work has been removed, and the ravines where it
was placed are being filled with substantial masonry and solid
embankments.</p>

<p>On the first day of November Mr. Farren had about fifty
men employed; on the first day of December, two hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
seventy-five, and on the 14th of December, when one of the
Committee visited the line, he had over three hundred.</p>

<p>About one-third of the masonry for Green River bridge has
been built, and the stone is quarried for the other bridges.
Nearly one thousand yards of culvert masonry and three
hundred yards of bank wall have been constructed, and from
forty to fifty thousand yards of earth removed.</p>

<p>The timber for Green River bridge is sawed and will be
framed in January. The material for all the bridges below
Shelburne Falls has been contracted for, to be delivered early
in the spring. Twenty thousand ties have been purchased,
together with posts and boards for fences. The work at the
rock-cut near Shelburne Falls will be commenced in the month
of January.</p>

<p>On the line below Shelburne Falls, there will remain in the
road, the following sharp curves, to wit: In the track as laid
and not disturbed, four of six degrees, and in the remainder of
the line, six of six degrees, three of seven, and two of eight.
One of the eight degree curves, is through a long heavy cut,
and cannot be reduced without great expense. The other is
near the Deerfield River crossing, where all trains will be
required to run slow. It cannot be avoided without a tunnel
or a curve over the entire bridge. The three seven degree
curves occur in heavy rock-cuttings, and these are all the sharp
curves that are contained in a space of thirteen miles.</p>

<p>Above Shelburne Falls the alignment and grades are more
favorable. From the tunnel to the Deerfield River crossing,
below Shelburne Falls, a distance of twenty-two miles, there is
but one ascending grade going east; its location is about two
miles west of the falls; it is one-half mile in length, and is thirty-five
feet to the mile. Within the same space going east, there
are the following descending grades, to wit: One of forty-five
feet per mile for 2,000 feet, one of forty feet for 6,000 feet, one
of twenty-eight feet for 2,500 feet, and one, near the village of
Shelburne Falls, of fifty feet per mile for 5,300 feet. The
remaining grades are from five to twenty feet per mile.</p>

<p>The sharp curves remaining after the proposed improvements
will be as follows, to wit: Near the depot grounds at Shelburne,
and running through the village, there is necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
one eight degree curve, and on the seventeen miles between
the falls and the tunnel, there occur thirteen six degree curves.
A slight change in laying the track will increase the radius of
these curves to 1,000 feet. This in some cases can be done.</p>

<p>The county commissioners have been called out and have
made an adjudication in regard to the public crossings and
alterations of highways between Greenfield and Shelburne
Falls.</p>

<p>The whole work below the falls is under good progress, and
is being prosecuted with great vigor. The laying of the track
can be commenced as early in the spring as the season will
admit, and its extension to Shelburne Falls, may, in the opinion
of the engineer, be expected early in October.</p>

<p>It appears from the foregoing, that of the work now in progress
on the road and tunnel, their is performed by contract,&mdash;the
construction of the railroad from Greenfield to the East
End of the tunnel; the enlargements east and west in the
tunnel at the West Shaft; the excavation of the New Shaft;
and the arch masonry and excavation at the West End; while
the work at the East End, at the Central Shaft, the heading
and lifting at the West Shaft, the lifting at the New Shaft, and
the work at the brickyard has been performed by the State.
No criterion has been afforded enabling the Committee to
determine upon the comparative economy of the different
modes of operation.</p>

<p>The commissioners in their able report in 1863, speaking of
the manner of constructing the tunnel, say: "It would not be
wise nor according to any precedent for the State to expect to
get the work done at the contract price if it should turn out to
cost more. It would certainly get no abatement if the price
was found to be exorbitant. We are clearly of the opinion that
it should not be constructed by contract, excepting in so far as
parts of the work may be in detail to the men actually at work
upon it, and even such contracts should' not be permanent in
their character." That the commissioners in April last entertained
the idea of inaugurating and continuing the contract
system so far as the same should prove economical for the State,
satisfactorily appears in the following letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="tdr">BOSTON April 25, 1866.</p>

<p class="center">Hon. <span class="smcap">Tappan Wentworth</span>, <i>Chairman of Hoosac Tunnel and Troy
and Greenfield Railroad Committee.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span>&mdash;Hearing that questions have arisen in regard to the
propriety of contracting the work upon the Hoosac Tunnel, it may not
be improper for me to say that that subject (contemplated in the Act of
1863,) has for a long time engaged the serious attention of the commissioners,
who have already a contract for constructing a portion of
the West End, before the governor and council, awaiting their approval
under section 3 of chapter 214 of the Acts of 1863.</p>

<p>When the economic value of their new facilities shall be demonstrated,
they expect further to avail of this system 80 far as the interest of the
State (as represented by the rapid, economical and certain progress of
the work,) shall warrant.</p>

<p>While the high prices now prevailing will probably render the letting
of large jobs at this time injudicious, they are not of short contracts, or
of letting portions of the work to the miners by the piece.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 45%">
Very truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left:3em">J. W. Brooks</span>, <i>Chairman</i>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The Committee coincide with the views of the commissioners.
And the justness of their remarks, that the State must not
expect to have the work done at less than its cost, is borne out
by the operations under the contract for the West End enlargement,
where the State has increased the contract from four to
seven dollars and fifty cents a perch, in order to insure the
miners a compensation for their labor.</p>

<p>It may be proper to state in this connection, that the labor
done upon the road and tunnel by early contractors, has not
tended to a "rapid, economical and certain progress of the
work," and that if even the whole work should be put under
contract, the interest of the Commonwealth would require the
continuance of a commission, and the services of an engineer
of the highest skill and integrity to superintend its performance
in order to avoid a loss and damage similar to that which
occurred to the State while the work was under the nominal
control of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad corporation.</p>

<p>The retirement of all the gentlemen who comprised the
board of commissioners, first appointed under the legislation
of 1862, affords the Committee an opportunity to acknowledge
the eminent talent and ability which they respectively possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
for the discharge of the important duties assigned to them, and
to bear testimony to the industry and intelligence displayed in
their elaborate and comprehensive report upon the subject of
the railroad and tunnel in 1863. It was fortunate for the
State in that crisis in the affairs of this enterprise to be able to
command so much practical information upon a question so
interesting and important, and at the same time so difficult
of solution.</p>

<p>But in addition to the duty of furnishing an opinion of the
feasibility and mode of constructing the tunnel, and of the propriety
of opening this line of railway communication with the
West, the commission was instituted to carry on and superintend
a most important and difficult public work, involving
the expenditure of several million dollars. Yet each of the
gentlemen composing the board was engaged in other duties
requiring substantially their whole time and attention. Under
these circumstances their personal observance of the progress
of the work could not be given to a degree satisfactory to the
public, or essential to the interests of the State, and the responsibility
of the operations came to devolve upon the engineer at
the works, and the chairman of the commissioners in Boston.
These irksome labors were discharged with diligent faithfulness,
and as the event has proved with a physical suffering to one of
them that has called forth a general expression of regret and sorrow.</p>

<p>By chapter 214 of the Acts of 1863, the governor is authorized
to draw his warrant on the treasurer for such sums as
may be required, from time to time, by the commissioners, for
the purpose of carrying out the provisions of law for the completion
of the tunnel and railroad. The commissioners under
this enactment have made monthly requisitions upon the governor,
transmitting at the same time vouchers for the expenses
of the preceding month; and upon this information and requisition
the warrants have been drawn. By the 293 chapter of
the Acts of 1866, a general supervision of the work is vested
in the governor and council, with power to "correct abuses,
remedy defects, and impose and enforce requirements in such
manner as the interests of the Commonwealth shall, in their
judgment, require." As the commissioners exercise a delegated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
power, there would have been a manifest propriety in
requiring of them, from time to time, a report upon the progress
of the work, and of their own doings even under the Act
1863, so that the governor might have been more fully provided
with information touching the necessity of the requisitions.
But under the Act of 1866, it appears essential that the commissioners
should report monthly to the governor and council the
general plan of operations pursued, the progress of the work,
and the manner and extent of their own superintendence of
the same.</p>

<p>The Committee are therefore of opinion that the commission
should be reorganized in such manner that the State could command
the whole time of its members: that a greater degree of
personal attention should be given by them to the work than it
has heretofore received: that the commissioners should keep
minutes of their doings which shall be open to the inspection
of the governor and council, and the appropriate legislative
committee: that their monthly communications to the governor
and council should embrace, in addition to the past, and
the requisition for the current month, a report of the operations,
the progress of the work during the previous, month,
and the manner and extent of their own superintendence
of the same.</p>

<p>The Committee are also of opinion that a due regard to
economy in conducting the enterprise requires that the commissioners
should at once, by experiment, ascertain the probable
time required to excavate the enlargement of the tunnel,
and that the work upon the enlargement be regulated and
pursued with a view of avoiding any unnecessary delay in
operating the road after the heading is removed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In concluding this Report, the Committee cannot forbear to
express their obligations to Mr. Doane, the engineer in charge
of the work, for the assistance rendered by him in aid of their
labors, nor withhold their approbation of the faithful and able
manner in which he has discharged the duties of his office, so
far as they have come under their observation. The Committee
are indebted to Mr. Hill, the superintendent of labor, for
his uniform attention during their examinations, and they fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
recognize his capacity for his position, and his interest in the
operations. They are likewise indebted to Mr. Hall, the intelligent
master of the machine shop, for very valuable information
concerning his particular department. And also to Mr. Field,
the able and efficient engineer of the railroad, for a very
satisfactory report upon that portion of the work under his
direction.</p>

<p><i>Sketch of the Proceedings of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad
Corporation, from its organization to the surrender of the
Road under the mortgage, and the adoption of the work by
the Commonwealth.</i></p></div>

<p>The charter of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, was granted in
1848, and authorized the construction of a railroad with one or more
tracks, from a point on the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, at or
near Greenfield, to some point on the line of New York or Vermont,
convenient to meet or connect with any railroad that may be constructed
from any point at or near the city of Troy, on the Hudson River in the
State of New York. Its capital stock was limited at $3,500,000.</p>

<p>The corporation was authorized to contract with the owners of any
contiguous railroad leading into or from either of the States of Vermont
or New York, for the use of the whole or any part thereof, or for the
running and operating the two railroads conjointly, or for the leasing of
such contiguous road, or for any other road, or for the letting or hiring
of their own road to the owners of such contiguous road, or of any
other road which composes a part of the railroad line between the cities
of Boston and Troy, of which the Troy and Greenfield Railroad shall
be a part.</p>

<p>The first meeting under the charter was held June I, 1848, at which
subscription papers were voted to be issued and circulated, in order to
organize the corporation. In 1849, March 16, the subscribers to the
stock held their first meeting, and organized under the charter.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting, February 6, 1850, the stock was apportioned
among the neighboring towns as follows:-</p>

<p>It was also voted to apportion the directors among the towns in the
following manner, to wit:&mdash;</p>

<p>North Adams, 3; Florida, Rowe, Heath and Monroe, 1; Colrain,
Buckland and Hawley, 1; Shelburne, 1; Greenfield, Deerfield and
Conway, 3; Williamstown and Whitingham, 2; Charlemont, 1; and
one director at large.</p>

<p>Before the annual meeting in 1850, the directors had voted to assess
three per cent. upon each share of the capital stock. This vote was
passed April 11, 1849, and on the first day of October in the same year,
they voted that the construction of the road from the State line at
Pownal, Vermont, to Adams, and from Greenfield to Shelburne Falls, be
put under contract as soon as sufficient subscription shall have been
obtained therefore, and that the two ends aforesaid shall be constructed
simultaneously.</p>

<p>1850, January 28, the treasurer had received the sum of $2,203.94,
and had paid out on bills approved by the president, $2,203.57, leaving a
balance in the treasury of $0.37.</p>

<p>Sundry assessments amounting in all to 75 per cent. upon the subscriptions,
were afterwards voted, the last on the 6th of May, 1852.
These assessments were rescinded by a vote passed July 23, 1858, and
it also voted that the several amounts heretofore paid by individual
stockholders, except on assessment laid April 11, 1849, be credited to
their several accounts on assessments now or hereafter to be made.</p>

<p>1850, October 28, the contract with Messrs. Gilman and Carpenter,
was ratified, and on the 29th, the president was authorized to execute it.</p>

<p>The Committee have not found this contract nor any record stating
its provisions.</p>

<p>December 27, 1850, a committee reported that the whole amount of
stock subscribed, was $250,800, of which $7,200 was payable in land
damages and materials for the road; and that Messrs. Gilmore and
Carpenter had subscribed for 500 shares of stock, to wit, $50,000.</p>

<p>On the 7th day of January, 1851, the directors voted to break ground
the next day, and on the 27th of May in the same year, they voted to
expend a sum not exceeding $25,000, in experiments upon the east side
of the mountain, at or near the mouth of the proposed tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1851, the corporation petitioned the legislature for a loan of the
State credit for two million dollars; but the application was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The failure to secure the aid of the Commonwealth, appears not to
have discouraged the corporation, for on the 7th of August, 1851, the
directors voted that they would proceed forthwith from Adams to the
New York line, and simultaneously incur all the necessary expenses to
make thorough experiments with such machines as promise to facilitate
the construction of the tunnel, and when the road is begun from Greenfield,
it shall be after an arrangement is made to construct it to the foot
of the mountain in Florida and connect in some way with the road at
North Adams.</p>

<p>The Troy and Greenfield Railroad Corporation having directed
its attention to a connection with the Troy and Boston Railroad Company
through a portion of the State of Vermont, and a charter having
been obtained from the legislature of Vermont, incorporating the
Southern Vermont Railroad Company, whereby such connection could
be made, a committee of the directors of the Troy and Greenfield
Railroad Company and of the Southern Vermont Railroad Company
made an agreement, subject to the modification or ratification of the
stockholders of each company, "that the stock of both of said companies
and their franchises from said Greenfield to the west line of
Pownal, in the State of Vermont, shall become and be one joint, consolidated
stock and interest, with equal and common rights and privileges
to the stockholders of both companies;" it being understood that
an application shall be made to the legislature of Vermont for a
change of the name and style of the joint corporation mentioned in the
said Act of the Vermont legislature. This report was made to the
board of directors, and it was voted that the same "be accepted and
adopted, recorded and placed on file." Subsequently the Southern Vermont
Railroad was leased to the Troy and Greenfield Corporation on a
perpetual lease for $12,000 per year; and the 21st of April, 1860, it
was purchased by the Troy and Greenfield Corporation for the sum of
two hundred thousand dollars, with money advanced to the last named
corporation by the Commonwealth. In the report of the commissioners
on the Troy and Greenfield Railroad and Hoosac Tunnel, the
Southern Vermont Railroad is estimated to have cost from $110,000 to
to $125,000 only.</p>

<p>In 1858, another application was made to the legislature for a loan,
but with the same result as in 1851. In both instances, committees
reported in favor of the application.</p>

<p>In 1854, the application was renewed, and was successful. The Act
was passed on the fifth day of April, 1854. By the first section, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
treasurer was authorized to issue scrip, as certificates of debt, for the
sum of two million dollars, to be expressed in the currency of Great
Britain or in federal currency, as the directors of the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad should elect, to bear an interest of five per cent.,
payable semi-annually, and redeemable in thirty years, for the purpose of
enabling the Troy and Greenfield Company to construct a tunnel and
railroad under and through the Hoosac Mountain, in some place between
the "Great Bend" in Deerfield River, in the town of Florida, at the
base of Hoosac Mountain, on the east, and the base of the western side
of the mountain, near the east end of the village of North Adams, on
the west. The scrip was to be delivered to the treasurer of said Troy
and Greenfield Railroad Company in the manner and upon the conditions
following:&mdash;$100,000, when it should appear to the satisfaction of
the governor and council that said company had obtained subscriptions
to their capital stock in the sum of $600,000, and twenty per cent.
upon each and every share of said six: hundred thousand dollars should
have actually been paid in, and seven miles of their railroad and one
thousand lineal feet of their said tunnel under the Hoosac, in one or
more sections, of size sufficient for one or more railroad tracks, should
have been completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when ten miles of their said railroad, in one or two sections,
and ten thousand lineal feet of their said tunnel, in one or more sections,
should be completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when fifteen miles of their said railroad, in one or two
sections, and three thousand lineal feet of their said tunnel, in one or
more sections, should be completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when twenty miles of their said railroad, in one or two
sections, and four thousand lineal feet of their said tunnel, in one or
more sections should be completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when twenty-five miles of their said railroad, in one or two
sections, and five thousand lineal feet of their said tunnel, in one or
more sections, should be completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when thirty miles of their railroad, in one or two sections,
and six thousand lineal feet of their tunnel, should be completed.</p>

<p>$100,000, when thirty-two miles of their railroad, in one or two
sections, including all the line east of Florida, and seven thousand lineal
feet of their tunnel, in one or more sections, should be completed; and
for each additional portion or portions of said tunnel of fifteen hundred
feet, in one or more sections, completed by said company, $100,000,
subject to the condition that the last $200,000 should be reserved until
said company, or their successors, should open their railroad for use
from Greenfield to the line of the State in Williamstown; and subject
also to the condition, that, prior to the second delivery of scrip, thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
per cent. of the same shall have been paid in cash to the treasurer of
the company by the stockholders thereof, in addition to the $120,000
to be paid prior to the delivery of any scrip; and that upon each application
for scrip, in pursuance of the law, and prior to the delivery
thereof, thirty per cent. of the scrip then applied for shall have been
paid by the stockholders to the treasurer of the company until the
$600,000 subscribed for has been paid by the stockholders.</p>

<p>The Act further provided, that the treasurer of the company, within
three months from the receipt of any scrip, should pay to the commissioners
of the sinking fund created by the Act, ten per cent. on the
amount of scrip so taken as a sinking fund; and after the road should
be opened for use, twenty-five thousand dollars should be annually paid
to said commissioners for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The Act further provided, that the said company should execute an
assignment, as a pledge or mortgage on the railroad, with its franchise
property and income, conditioned to pay the principal sum of said scrip,
or so much thereof as the sinking fund should be insufficient to pay, and
the interest, as the same became due; and that said company should
assign all the interest it then had, or might afterwards obtain, in the
Southern Vermont Railroad Company.</p>

<p>In 1855, the legislature authorized certain towns on the line,&mdash;to wit:
Ashfield, Buckland, Conway, Colrain, Charlemont, Deerfield, Greenfield,
Hawley, Heath, Rowe, Shelburne, Adams, Florida, and Williamstown,&mdash;to
subscribe three per cent. on their valuation, respectively, to
the capital stock. This Act was not fully complied with on the part of
the towns, and $125,000 only is reported to have been realized from
that source.</p>

<p>In 1855 a contract with E. W. Serrell to construct the work was
reported to and accepted by the directors. This contract does not
appear among the papers of the corporation, and its terms cannot be
stated.</p>

<p>At the same time the capital stock of the corporation was by a vote
increased to $1,500,000, and a location designated as the east line on
the railroad near Cheapside was adopted. This singular resolution was
also passed:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the direction of the engineering operations within the
Hoosac Tunnel after the location of the line is adopted, and plans perfected
for the same, be left with the contractor, excepting the measurements
for monthly and final estimates and the final acceptance of the
work.</p>

<p>1855, July 18. Mr. Serrell having proposed to subscribe the sum of
$600,000 (less the amount of the new subscription made by others,)
provided the company would make such allowances as would enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him to dispose of the proposed issue of $900,000 of bonds advantageously,
the directors voted to add $300,000 to the contract prices of
the work, and that said $900,000 bonds as provided by the contract
should be issued as soon as authorized by the stockholders, and placed
in bank by the trustees to the credit of such persons as shall deposit
against the same cash or railroad iron equal in value to sixty-five cents
on the dollar. The said bonds to be taken by said Serrell at par and so
estimated in his contract.</p>

<p>At this time sixteen hundred and thirty-five shares of new stock had
been subscribed, amounting to $163,500.</p>

<p>The trustees alluded to in the foregoing vote were selected by a committee
appointed for the purpose, and with power to execute to them a
mortgage. They were J. V. C. Smith, Paul Adams and John G. Davis,
all of Boston. The mortgage was executed, and is known in the history
of the road as the "Smith mortgage." A resolution explanatory of
this transaction was passed August 16, 1855, in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That, whereas by the terms of the provisions of the resolution
of July 18, 1855, by which it is provided that the bonds of the
company to be issued, are to be placed in bank, &amp;c.; therefore, as
explanatory thereto, be it</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That it is not intended thereby to prevent the operation of
the contract, but that the said bonds are to be delivered to Serrell &amp; Co.,
on the warrant of the engineer, countersigned by the president and
treasurer, whenever the engineer shall draw therefore on monthly
or final estimates."</p>

<p>1856, February 7. The president reported to the directors that a
contract had been redrafted and concluded with Messrs. Serrell, Haupt
&amp; Co., which was read, accepted and ratified, and the committee discharged.
This contract was probably dated January 31, 1856, but the
Committee have not been able to find it among the papers of the
corporation.</p>

<p>1856, May 22. The directors voted, that in case Messrs. Serrell,
Haupt &amp; Co., would enter into an agreement to carry on the work of
the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, in compliance with the
terms and conditions of the loan Act, until 2,000 feet of the tunnel should
be completed, the corporation would substitute bonds instead of stock in
all payments to be made on account of work to be done to that time.</p>

<p>The treasurer was authorized to give the acceptance or notes of the
company, to an extent equal to the whole indebtedness of the company
to said contractors, upon which to raise money to carry on the work.</p>

<p>That the company would pay or allow to said contractors all discounts
or losses to which they might be required to submit, provided such
discounts or losses did not exceed the rate of 15 per cent. per annum.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>That the trustees of the mortgage bonds should deliver to Mr. Herman
Haupt one hundred thousand dollars in the bonds of the company
in addition to payments due for work, said bonds to be sold or hypothecated
by him, and the proceeds applied to the work. The bonds to be
charged on account of the contract if not returned when the second
payment from the State shall have been made.</p>

<p>1856, July 28. H. Haupt and W. A. Galbraith notified a dissolution
of the firm of Serrell, Haupt &amp; Co., and proposed to enter into a new
contract.</p>

<p>E. W. Serrell notified that Messrs. Haupt and Galbraith were authorized
to surrender the old contract.</p>

<p>The stock subscription of Edward W. Serrell and E. W. Serrell &amp;
Co., was transferred to H. Haupt &amp; Co., the latter to furnish a guarantee
that the assessments due and to become due should be paid.</p>

<p>E. W. Serrell resigned his office as a director in the company, and
was appointed consulting engineer. W. A. Galbraith was chosen a
director.</p>

<p>1865, July 30. A contract was made with Herman Haupt, William
A. Galbraith, C. B. Duncan and Henry Cartwright for the construction
of the road and tunnel. The firm name of the contractors was H.
Haupt &amp; Co. By the provisions of the contract all work done under
previous contracts with E. W. Serrell or Serrell, Haupt &amp; Co., was to
be credited to H. Haupt &amp; Co., and all payments under said contracts
were to be charged to H. Haupt &amp; Co., and credited to the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad. "The road from the eastern terminus at or near
Greenfield from some convenient point on the Vermont and Massachusetts
line, as the same now is or hereafter be located," is assumed to
be in all about forty-two miles in length.</p>

<p>"This contract includes the graduation, tunneling, masonry and
bridging, superstructure, fencing, depot buildings, switches, turn-tables,
water and fixtures, and in fine all labor and materials necessary for the
construction of the road are included in this contract." The right of
way to be provided and paid for by the railroad company. The work
to be completed and finished in the best manner, for which the Troy
and Greenfield Railroad Company agreed to pay H. Haupt &amp; Co., "the
sum of three millions eight hundred and eighty-three thousand dollars
in manner following, to wit: Two millions of dollars in the bonds of the
State of Massachusetts, to be issued under the Act by which the credit
of the said State is loaned to said corporation, nine hundred thousand
dollars in the six per cent. mortgage bonds of said company, five
hundred and ninety-eight thousand dollars in the capital stock of said
Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, and three hundred and eighty-two
thousand dollars in cash." The work of constructing and completing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the road was to be done in compliance with the loan Act of April, 1854.
One hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be expended by the contractors
in depot buildings and necessary rolling stock, cars, engines, &amp;c.
under the direction of the board of directors. The stock subscription
of E. W. Serrell and of Serrell &amp; Co., amounting to five thousand nine
hundred and eighty-seven shares, was to be transferred and assumed by
Haupt &amp; Co., payable in compliance with said Loan Act with the understanding
that the assessments on the stock were to be paid by the performance
of this contract in stock credits as provided in the contract, and
the stock taken by the contractors at par.</p>

<p>This contract further provided, that on the receipt of the several
installments of State bonds, the contractors should pay to the sinking
fund the ten per cent. specified in the Loan Act, in consideration of
which Haupt &amp; Co. should retain whatever sums was realized from the
exchange and premium on the bonds. The payments were to be made
monthly, on estimate of the company's engineer. The cost of the
materials and work upon the line, exclusive of the Hoosac Tunnel and
its approaches, was assumed to be one million eight hundred and eighty
thousand dollars, and the estimates were to be made in the relative proportion
that the part done bore "to the whole amount of materials and
work to be furnished, and done at the price named." The Hoosac Tunnel
and its approaches were estimated at two million dollars for a double
track, and the monthly estimates were to be in proportion to the
amount of work done on the approaches, and the length of tunnel
excavated.</p>

<p>The contract further provided, that, with the assent of both parties,
the tunnel might be constructed for a single track, in which case no
abatement was to be made for the first three thousand feet; but for the
excavation beyond that point, the sum of twelve dollars per lineal foot
was to be deducted from the contract price.</p>

<p>The above are the essential provisions of the contract under which
H. Haupt &amp; Co. performed their work upon the road and tunnel until
February 18, 1858, except as the same was modified and changed by
votes of the directors. The contract was reported to the board of
directors, and approved by them August 6, 1856. On the same day
the directors voted to request the trustees to recognize H. Haupt &amp; Co.
as contractors, instead of E. W. Serrell, and to issue the bonds to said
H. Haupt &amp; Co. on the estimate of the engineer and the order of the
trustees.</p>

<p>They also voted to change the location of the road at the West End,
in accordance with plans marked A and B.</p>

<p>Under date of July 10, 1857, there appears upon the records the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>A preamble, "stating that the efforts to raise money for building the
road had proved unsuccessful; that no payments had been made the
contractors for more than a year, * * * *; that the work could only
be carried on by the continued efforts * * * * and personal credit of the
contractors.</p>

<p>"Therefore voted, that the whole of the State bonds that may be
issued in aid of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company shall be
exclusively appropriated to work done, or to be done, upon the tunnel,
in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Act authorizing the
loan of credit, and with such other conditions and modifications as the
legislature may, from time to time, make and establish; but said H.
Haupt &amp; Co. shall not be held subject to any other conditions whatever,
so far as respects the work done upon the tunnel; and any State scrip
that may at any time be delivered to the treasurer of the company, shall
be promptly handed to the contractors; the contractors, on their part,
to comply with the conditions of the present Act, and with such other
conditions or modifications as may be introduced, and to have the benefit
of any extension of time or increase of compensation by the State.</p>

<p>Second. Any new or additional subscription that may be obtained,
shall be applied to payment of the present contractors for work done, or
to be done, by them, and to no other object; and any subscriptions that
may be collected west of the Hoosac Mountain, shall be applied
exclusively to the completion of that portion of the road.</p>

<p>Third. The present subscription east of the Hoosac Mountain may
be collected and applied to the payment of other liabilities of the corporation,
and the treasurer is requested to prepare, without delay, a full
and complete list of all such liabilities.</p>

<p>Fourth. Any commissions for procuring or collecting subscriptions
shall be paid by H. Haupt &amp; Co., in consideration of which, and also of
the premises, the payment of graduation, masonry, bridging, and superstructure
on the road, exclusive of the tunnel, shall be two million
dollars, with the addition of such sums as may be required for the right
of way, if this item shall be paid by the contractors. Of this amount,
nine hundred thousand dollars shall be in mortgage bonds of the company,
and the balance in cash, to as great an extent as can be procured,
the remainder in stock at par; and the directors of the Troy and Greenfield
Railroad Company shall use their best endeavors to increase the
cash subscriptions as much as possible.</p>

<p>If new parties be introduced, or desired by H. Haupt &amp; Co., the contract
may be redrafted, and these conditions and changes incorporated;
the committee for this purpose shall consist of the president and Alvah
Crocker, with power to execute it finally, if not inconsistent with the
present contract, or with the changes hereby authorized. It is further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
agreed and understood, that nothing herein contained shall be so constrained
as to invalidate the existing contract with said Haupt &amp; Co., or
vary its conditions, except so far as herein expressed or necessarily
implied."</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, 1858, another agreement was made by
Herman Haupt and Henry Cartwright with the Troy and Greenfield
Railroad Company, and such others as might be associated with them;
and who upon signing the contract were to be considered as parties to the
same; as it bears the signatures of D. N. Carpenter, President for the
Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, and H. Haupt &amp; Co., by H.
Haupt, and no others, it may be presumed that Messrs. Haupt and Cartwright
are the only persons comprising the party of the first part.</p>

<p>This contract recites that every attempt to procure new or to collect
old subscriptions to the capital stock of the company, since the execution
of the former contract with H. Haupt &amp; Co., have proved unsuccessful;
that the contractors had prosecuted the work for more than two years
without any payment having been made to them as required by existing
contract; that there appeared no possibility of procuring means for the
further prosecution of the work, except by the continued efforts,
increased expenditures, and personal credit of the contractors themselves;
and that H. Haupt &amp; Co. propose to release the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad Company from the cash payments required by the
contract, and to assume themselves the labor of procuring and collecting
subscriptions, and of carrying on and completing the Troy and Greenfield
Railroad and Hoosac Tunnel in such manner as will comply with
all the conditions of the Loan Act. The parties therefore agreed.</p>

<p>That H. Haupt &amp; Co. should comply with all the conditions of the
Act, approved April 5th, 1854, whereby a loan of credit was given by
the State of Massachusetts in aid of the construction of the Hoosac
Tunnel, and should have the benefit of any changes that may hereafter
be obtained, or extensions of time that may be granted; but they shall
be subject to no other conditions or restrictions other than those
expressed in this contract.</p>

<p>That the road shall be so constructed that its gradients should not
exceed those in each direction which exist or may hereafter exist permanently
on other portions of the line between Troy and Boston; that
sharper curves than were in ordinary use in other parts of the line
were to be changed at the expense of the contractors, and trestle work
or temporary bridging was to be replaced by permanent structures at
the expense of the contractors as soon as practicable after the completion
and opening of the whole line.</p>

<p>That H. Haupt &amp; Co. should have the benefit of all existing subscriptions,
and of all they might procure; also of any revenue that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
might arise from the use of the road, or any portion of it when completed,
until their claims on the company were discharged and paid;
and to secure this end, the payment of all other debts of the corporation
was to be deferred until that of the contractors was satisfied. The
real estate of the corporation not required for the purposes and use of the
road, was to be sold or applied to meet present liabilities of the company;
and Haupt &amp; Co. were to maintain the organization of the corporation
and pay its necessary printing expenses, by paying to the treasurer
annually a sum not less than five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The State bonds were to be appropriated exclusively to the construction
of the tunnel. The State scrip delivered to the treasurer of the
company was to be promptly handed to the contractors.</p>

<p>The compensation to be allowed to H. Haupt &amp; Co. was to be as
provided in the resolutions of the directors, passed July 10, 1857.</p>

<p>The payment for graduation, bridging, masonry, and superstructure
on the road, exclusive of the tunnel, was fixed at two million dollars,
exclusive of any payments that might be made for the right of way.
Of this amount, nine hundred thousand dollars was to be paid in mortgage
bonds of the company; the balance in cash, to as great an extent
as cash subscriptions could be secured; the remainder in stock at par.</p>

<p>The bonds and stock of the company to be issued to H. Haupt &amp;
Co. when required, to an amount equal to the work done, estimating it
by the proportion it bore to the whole amount performed and to be
performed.</p>

<p>H. Haupt &amp; Co. were authorized to collect subscriptions to the capital
stock of the company, and their receipt for money was to be accepted
by the company as evidence of payment. By the execution of this
agreement all former contracts between the same parties were agreed to
be annulled and cancelled.</p>

<p>H. Haupt &amp; Co. was recognized as the firm name under which the parties
of the first part were associated, and then to be conducted. Copies
of this and the preceding contract will be found printed verbatim in a
report of a committee of the House of Representatives in 1860, of
which Mr. Kimball, of Boston, was chairman. It was reprinted in
1861, and is House document No. 406, of last year; and it may be
profitably consulted for other valuable information touching the doings
of the Troy and Greenfield Corporation and the contractors therewith.</p>

<p>1858, May 25, the directors assented that the iron delivered by the
Rensselaer Iron Company for the road should remain the property of
the iron company until the same was paid for, in accordance with an
agreement of H. Haupt &amp; Co. with the iron company.</p>

<p>From a report of a committee of the directors made to the board
July 23, 1858, it appears that at the date of the report, seven thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
four hundred and fifteen, shares were subscribed for unconditionally by
parties who appeared to have been solvent at the time of subscribing.</p>

<p>That three thousand four hundred and fifty shares had been subscribed
for conditionally, or, by parties who were not solvent, or whose
subscriptions could not be collected.</p>

<p>That of the conditional subscriptions, the greater part had been or
would be complied with; of these nine hundred and thirty-nine were
subscribed by the towns not included in the published lists.</p>

<p>Upon two thousand four hundred and thirty shares of the unconditional
subscriptions, including those of Gilmore and Carpenter, twenty per
cent. only had been paid.</p>

<p>That upon six thousand five hundred and nine shares, subscribed for
unconditionally, twenty per cent. or more had been paid in cash.</p>

<p>At this date it appears that the whole number of shares subscribed
for conditionally and unconditionally, was ten thousand eight hundred
and sixty-five.</p>

<p>At this meeting of the board the clerk was directed to place upon
the record the names of all the stockholders, with the number of shares
held by each, on which twenty per cent. or more had been paid. The
record shows the number of shares to be six thousand six hundred and
forty-eight, and the amount paid on the same two hundred and sixty-seven
thousand five hundred and sixty-nine dollars. Against the name
of H. Haupt &amp; Co. was set the number of five thousand shares. At
this meeting the directors also voted to fix the capital stock at one
million five hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>1858, September 3. The last vote was reconsidered, and it was
voted that the capital stock be fixed at [Note: amount missing]
as represented by the list of stock reported at the previous meeting.</p>

<p>The directors also voted as they had previously done, to rescind all
the assessments heretofore voted, except the assessment of three per
cent. laid April 11, 1849, and then voted an assessment of ten per cent.
upon each and every share in the capital stock of the company, payable
in thirty days. Between this date and September 14, 1859, nine other
assessments were voted, the whole amounting to eighty-eight per cent.
of the par value of the stock.</p>

<p>By another entry upon the records, under date of November 3, 1858,
it appears that Williamstown and Adams subscribed to the capital stock
of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, ninety-three thousand dollars, upon
condition that the payment should be made in town scrip, maturing in
thirty years, and to be issued whim the road was completed between
Adams and Troy; half the interest on the scrip to be paid by the Troy
and Boston Railroad Company. Mortgage bonds of the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad Company, in amount equal to said subscription,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
were to be deposited in the Adams Bank as security against loss of stock
from such a contingency as a sale of the road by the <i>bona fide</i> holders.</p>

<p>Immediately following this entry upon the records are recorded these
votes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, To accept the subscription on the condition stated, that
the contract with the Troy and Boston Railroad Company be altered to
allow said company to pay the interest on the scrip directly to the
treasurers of the towns; that bonds to the amount of ninety-three
thousand dollars be prepared ready for delivery, and that Mr. Haupt
and the treasurer be a committee to carry this vote into effect, as also
any change of contract with the Troy and Boston Railroad Company.</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, That the trustees of the mortgage bonds of this corporation
be, and hereby are, requested to deliver to Mr. H. Haupt and the treasurer,
ninety-three bonds of one thousand dollars each, to be deposited
by them in the Adams Bank, in compliance with the conditions and
requirements of the votes of towns of Adams and Williamstown, &amp;c., &amp;c.;
sixty bonds to be appropriated as security for Adams, and thirty-three
for Williamstown.</p>

<p>Under date of May 20, 1859, appears the following record:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whereas, satisfactory evidence has been afforded to the board of
directors of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company that H.
Haupt has, by an instrument of writing, duly executed, formally relinquished,
for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, all pecuniary
interest in any profits that may be realized in the construction
of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad and Hoosac Tunnel, and that the
use of his name in connection with the firm is merely nominal, to avoid
the inconvenience and embarrassment resulting from a change of title:</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, That in the opinion of this board, no impediment exists to prevent
the said H. Haupt from performing the duties of chief engineer of
the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, and that he be, and hereby
is, appointed to said office.</p>

<p>1859, December 26. <i>Voted</i>, That the treasurer be, and hereby is,
directed to hand over to H. Haupt &amp; Co., as soon as received by him,
the bonds of the Commonwealth, hereafter to be issued in aid of the
road or tunnel, taking their receipt therefore.</p>

<p>In 1859, application was made to the legislature to reduce the size of
the tunnel in order to facilitate its completion, and by chapter 117, of
the Acts of that year, it was provided that the tunnel might be constructed
of the height of eighteen feet, and fourteen feet wide, and the payments
were changed so as to depend upon the construction of the railroad, the
excavation of the tunnel, and also of the heading, which was to be driven
of the width of fourteen feet at the bottom, and the height of six feet
in the middle, with a proviso that no more than seventeen hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
thousand dollars (in addition to the six hundred thousand dollars of
scrip,) of stock subscriptions, and the anticipated scrip from the towns
before, mentioned, all of which was to be considered as unconditional
subscriptions, should be paid until the whole of the tunnel through the
Hoosac Mountain shall have been completed, and the payments by the
State were not to commence until twenty per cent. of the stock subscription
should "have been actually paid in." The provisions of this Act,
in regard to advances by the State for progress actually made in excavating
the tunnel and constructing the road, were substituted for those
of the Act of 1854, the second section of which was repealed. By chapter
184 of the Acts of 1860, the city of Boston was authorized, with
the consent of the legal voters, to subscribe five hundred thousand dollars
to the capital stock of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad; but the
consent was not given.</p>

<p>The legislation of 1859 did not meet the exigencies of the corporation,
and application for assistance was again made. To relieve still further
the difficulties of the company, the Act of 1860, chapter 202, was passed,
in which it was provided that the undelivered portion of the loan of
two million of dollars, authorized by chapter 226 of the Acts of 1854,
amounting to one million seven hundred and seventy thousand dollars,
should be apportioned between the railroad and tunnel, and for the construction
of each respectively, and six hundred and fifty thousand dollars
was set apart for the completion of the unfinished portion of the railroad,
extending from its eastern terminus, near Greenfield, to within half a
mile of the eastern end of the Hoosac Tunnel, and one million one hundred
and twenty thousand dollars to the completion of the tunnel. The
Act provided for the execution to the Commonwealth of such further
bond and mortgage as the attorney-general should prescribe, and that
such bond and mortgage, as well as all bonds, mortgages or other assurances
heretofore made to the Commonwealth by said company, should
have priority and be preferred before any and all attachments or levies
on execution heretofore or hereafter made. The Act further provided
that payments hereafter to be made for work done upon the road and
tunnel, should be so made upon estimates of a State engineer, whose
appointment and duties were prescribed in the Act. Such estimates
were to be based upon a "width of road-bed, at grade, of fifteen feet on
embankments, seventeen and a half feet in side cots, and twenty feet in
through cuts; in the heading of the tunnel, upon dimensions fourteen
feet wide and six feet high in the middle, and in the finished excavation
of the tunnel, of fourteen feet wide and eighteen feet high in the middle."
And the deliveries of scrip were to be at the rate of fifty dollars
for each lineal foot of tunnel, divided between heading and full-sized
tunnel, in the proportion of thirty dollars for each lineal foot of heading,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and twenty dollars per lineal foot for the remaining excavation, and of
six hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the whole of the graduation,
masonry, bridging and superstructure of the road east of the tunnel.
The weight of the rails was fixed at not less than fifty-six pounds to
the lineal yard; the capital stock of the corporation at two millions and
a half dollars, including all shares before issued.</p>

<p>By the eighth section of the Act the corporation was authorized to
purchase the entire road franchise, stock, bonds, and other property or
the Southern Vermont Railroad Company, together with its lease to the
Troy and Boston Railroad Company, and subject to its provisions, for
the sum of two hundred thousand dollars. This Act repealed all prior
legislation inconsistent with its provisions, with a saving of the security
which the Commonwealth had, by virtue of its mortgage on the franchise,
railroad and property of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company,
and was approved April 4, 1860.</p>

<p>1860, July 3. A committee was appointed to execute the mortgage
to the Commonwealth required by chapter 202, of the Acts of 1860.</p>

<p>1861, July 30. The directors voted that Mr. Haupt be a committee
to appear before the council in reference to the withholding the scrip
now due the road; and January 16, 1862, it was voted that Mr. Haupt
be authorized to act as the agent and representative of the company in
any relation that the company may be brought before the present legislature
or any committee thereof.</p>

<p>Previous to the vote of July, 1861, suspicion was excited that Messrs.
H. Haupt &amp; Co. were not performing their work in a manner conformable
to the requirements of the statute, and it was deemed imprudent
to make any further advance of scrip under the Act of 1859, until the
work was examined and the condition of the corporation better understood.
An inquiry was instituted, a new State engineer appointed, and
an investigation of the proceedings of the contractors and corporation
was had. The facts disclosed in the examination induced the governor
and council to withhold the issue of any more scrip, under the last
mentioned law, and the legislature by chapter 156 of the Acts of 1862,
passed April 28, assumed the duty of completing the road and tunnel.</p>

<p>The first section of the Act is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The governor, with the advice of the council, is hereby authorized
and directed to appoint three able, impartial and skilful commissioners,
to investigate the subject of finishing the Troy and Greenfield Railroad,
and of tunneling the Hoosac Mountain, whose duty it shall be to report
to the governor and council, what in their judgment, will be the most
economical, practical and advantageous method of completing said road
and tunnel; the estimated cost of fitting the same for use; the time
within which the tunnel can be completed, and what contracts can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
effected and with what parties for completing said tunnel and road and
the probable cost of the same; the probable pecuniary value of the
road and tunnel when completed; the sources and amount of traffic and
income, and all other facts, in their opinion, useful to assist the governor
and council in determining the best method of securing a continuous
railroad communication between Troy and Greenfield."</p>

<p>By the second section the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company
was authorized to surrender to the State the property mortgaged.</p>

<p>By the third section the commissioners were authorized to audit and
allow all just claims for labor, service, materials and land damages
incurred between April 6, 1860 and July 12, 1861, in carrying on the
work, and to procure the release and discharge of all attachments and
liens upon said materials. $175,000 was appropriated to pay the claimants
under the approval of the governor and council.</p>

<p>By the fourth section the commissioners were authorized to use or run
that portion of the road east of the mountain or lease the same to the
"Vermont and Massachusetts," the "Fitchburg," the "Troy and Boston
Railway Company," or either of them, until the completion of the tunnel.</p>

<p>By the fifth section the commissioners were authorized to continue
the work on the Hoosac Tunnel, and by contract or otherwise, to expedite
its completion.</p>

<p>On the 18th of August 1862, is recorded on the records of the
corporation the following votes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "The directors of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company
hereby instruct the president to transfer to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, under the several mortgages held by said Commonwealth,
all the property of said corporation.</p>

<p>2. "<i>Voted</i> to call a meeting of the stockholders to see if they would
ratify the above vote.</p>

<p>3. "<i>Voted</i>, That the treasurer be directed to make no further delivery
of the stock or bonds to the contractors without the written order of all
the finance committee."</p>

<p>At the commencement of the session of the legislature in January,
1863, his Excellency Governor Andrew, after stating the general provisions
of the Act of April, 1862, and the appointment of the commissioners
under it, "each of whom was carefully selected as being, in the
words of the Act, at once 'able, impartial and skilful,'" and after
alluding to the labors of the commissioners, and the reports of the distinguished
engineers appointed to "assist them, closes his remarks upon
the enterprise in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The report of the commissioners to the governor and council is
not yet made, but it is understood to be in rapid preparation. I am
unable, therefore, to communicate to the legislature at the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of its present session so fully as I have hoped on the subject of this
important and interesting enterprise of establishing a new avenue for
our trade with the West, piercing the Green Mountain range, and
opening up to greater activity the economical resources of our Northern
tier of towns. I trust that the conclusions and reasoning of the commissioners
when published will settle conflicting opinions in the minds
of the people, and, if favorable to the active pursuit of the enterprise,
that its prosecution will enjoy an unanimous support. The work can
be pursued, relieved from all factitious embarrassments, and contracts
can be made by those in the sole interest of the Commonwealth, superintended
by citizens of the highest experience and capacity."</p>

<p>In communicating the report of the commissioners to the legislature
on the 12th of March, 1863, after analyzing and commenting upon its
statements and reasonings, the governor concludes his address in these
words: "I congratulate thee general court and the people upon the
rescue of the Commonwealth, and especially of this great experimental
enterprise, from a position inconsistent with economical, safe, or even
possible success in piercing its mountain barrier.</p>

<p>"I earnestly and respectfully invite your most candid and thoughtful
consideration, not only of the specific facts and figures which elucidate
or express the details of information bearing most immediately upon the
work contemplated, but I also venture to commend to your deliberate
judgment the arguments and reasonings drawn from liberal and enlightened
views of public policy and of public economy, which finally lift
this subject above all merely local interests or antagonisms into the
sphere of statesmanship. And having attentively watched the progress
of the report of the commissioners, and the documents by which it is
accompanied through the press, I am prepared to give my own assent
to the opinion with the expression of which the commissioners conclude
their discussion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'By the time the tunnel can be completed, the public interest requiring
it will have grown large enough to pay for the outlay. The impulse
given to business by the new facility, would soon fill up the new line,
and make up the temporary loss felt by any other.</p>

<p>"'Considering the large sum which the Commonwealth has already
invested in this work, which must be sunk if it is not completed; the
reasonable protection from loss which is offered by the other companies
interested in the line; the more intimate relations it may promote
between Massachusetts and the West; and the benefits which such a
facility promises to the city and State, we are of opinion that the
work should be undertaken by the Commonwealth, and completed as
early as it can be with due regard to economy.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The surrender of the road by the directors to the Commonwealth,
was followed by the following vote, passed January 7, 1863:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Voted</i>, That Mr. Stevenson, formerly State Engineer of the Troy
and Greenfield Railroad, be requested to return an estimate of the
payments and credits to which Haupt &amp; Co. were entitled, under their
contract, at the time of the suspension of the work, and that the amount
allowed by such estimate be passed to the credit of H. Haupt &amp; Co.;
also, that the stock and bonds to which they are entitled be issued
without further order, when legal impediments are removed.</p>

<p>Under the vote, Mr. Stevenson made the following report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdr">
<i>Engineer's Office, Bunker Hill Bank Building,;</i>}<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Charlestown, Mass.</span>, Feb. 10, 1863.}</span><br />
</p>

<p class="pml0"><span class="smcap">D. N. Carpenter</span>, Esq., <i>President, pro tem., T. &amp; G. R. R; Co.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span>&mdash;By a vote passed on the 7th of January last, I am
requested to return an estimate of the payments and credits to which
H. Haupt &amp; Co. were entitled under their contract at the time of the
suspension of the work on the Troy and Greenfield Railroad.</p>

<p>The contract thus alluded to recites that "The compensation to be
allowed to H. Haupt &amp; Co. shall be as provided in the resolutions of
the board of directors of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company,
passed July 10, A. D. 1857, to wit:</p>

<p>"The whole of the State bonds that may be issued in aid of the Troy
and Greenfield Railroad Company shall be exclusively appropriated to
work done, or to be done, upon the tunnel, in compliance with the terms
and conditions of the Act authorizing the loan of credit; and any State
scrip that may,' at any time, be delivered to the treasurer of the company
shall be promptly handed to the contractors.</p>

<p>"The payments for graduation, bridging, masonry, and superstructure
of the road, exclusive of the tunnel, shall be two millions of dollars,
with the addition of such sums as may be required for right of
way, if this item shall be paid by the contractors. Of this amount,
nine hundred thousand dollars shall be in the mortgage bonds of the
company, and the balance shall be in cash, to as great an extent as cash
subscription can be procured; the remainder in stock, at par.</p>

<p>"The bonds and stock of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company
shall be issued to H. Haupt &amp; Co. whenever required, but not to a
greater extent than they would be entitled to receive for the work done,
estimating' it by the proportion which it bears to the whole amount
done and to be done."</p>

<p>This contract is so clear and precise in its terms that but one construction
can be placed upon it, though it is evident that such terms
were predicated upon a different state of affairs than existed at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
time of suspension. By this contract, all State payments are to be
exclusively appropriated to the work on the tunnel, while the stock and
bonds are as exclusively devoted to the graduation, bridging, masonry,
and superstructure of the railroad. The amount of compensation the
contractors would thus be entitled to, is the issue of State scrip from
July 10th, 1857, to the time of suspension, and the $2,000,000 of stock
and bonds, less the amount required to finish the railroad. From this
must be deducted such payments as may have been made from time to
time, concerning which I have no data, but which your treasurer's
books must show. Any sums that may have been paid by the contractors
for right of way, are to be added to the amount due.</p>

<p>The cost of finishing the railroad must be estimated. For the road
east of the tunnel, my estimate of the cost of finishing was, September
12, 1861, $102,394; to this we should add one-half mile of railroad
and bridge over the Deerfield, $20,000. For the unfinished portion
west of the tunnel, I have no data of my own; I have, therefore, taken
for the purpose the estimate of D. L. Harris, which is the highest I can
find&mdash;$40,000.</p>

<p>We thus have as the cash cost of completing the graduation,
masonry, bridging, and superstructure of the road, $162,394, which is
to be deducted from the $2,000,000 of stock and bonds, leaving the
amount the contractors are entitled to, $1,857,606, less payments made,
plus the amount of right of way, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is in exact accordance with the strict construction of the contract
which I previously have remarked was predicted upon a different condition
of affairs than existed at the time of suspension.</p>

<p>I deem it my duty in this connection respectfully to suggest whether,
in view of the changes made in the issue of State scrip, which was paid
upon the road as well as upon the tunnel, the contractors should not
make proper reductions of the stock and bonds due them, taking into
consideration as an offset to this such losses as they have been subjected
to by the adverse action of the State authorities. This suggestion, however,
is volunteered. My duty under the vote of the board is simply to
decide what amount the contractors are entitled to receive under an
exact and literal construction of the contract.</p>

subsequent to the message of the governor, from the foregoing, extracts
have been made, to wit: On the first day of April, 1863, the following
preamble and resolutions were passed by the directors.</p>

<p>"On motion of Mr. Brigham, seconded by Mr. Cheever, the following
resolutions were adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Whereas</i>, The stockholders of this company at their annual meeting
held September 2, 1862, unanimously acquiesced in the action which
the legislature had taken in regard to the affairs of this company, and
voted to surrender the property of the corporation to the Commonwealth
in the expectation that the railroad and tunnel should be completed
in conformity with the avowed intention of the legislature. It is</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That this board of directors see no reason to regret the
step which this corporation has taken, but in the kindly interest shown
by His Excellency the governor in this enterprise, and in the able
report of the commissioners appointed to examine the subject, they
perceive every indication that the great work will be prosecuted with
vigor and arrive at an early completion.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That having released the property to the Commonwealth,
we recognize the State as having entire and complete control over the
same; our only claim being that the State shall carry out in good
faith the recommendations of the commissioners as contained in their
report, and in the address of the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the clerk be requested to furnish copies of the above
vote to the friends of the road in the Senate and House of Representatives,
to be used if necessary to show the views of the directors."</p>

<p>On the 29th day of April, 1863, the legislature, passed an Act entitled
"an Act in addition to an Act, providing for the more speedy completion
of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad, and Hoosac Tunnel," which is
chapter 214 of the Acts of 1863. By the provisions of this Act, the
commissioners appointed under chapter 156 of the previous year, were
authorized, subject to the advice and approval of the governor and council,
to construct, complete and equip the Troy and Greenfield Railroad
and Hoosac Tunnel, and to make such alterations in the line of the
road as may be deemed necessary to render it suitable and proper for
part of a through line from Troy to Boston. Also such alterations in
the location and dimensions of said tunnel as will render it suitable and
proper for use, in accordance with the spirit and intent of the 224th
chapter of the Acts of 1854.</p>

<p>By the legislation of 1862 and 1863, and the vote of the directors
and of the corporation in the same years, the corporation surrendered
to the State the road and tunnel, and the State took possession of the
same with the express understanding on both sides, that they would
proceed in the construction and completion of both works. The enterprise
having fallen into the hands of the State, and the work having
been assumed by the State government, no further vote of importance
appears upon the records of the directors. Their last meeting was
held August 30, 1865, when Alvah Crocker was chosen President,
and Wendell T. Davis, Clerk and Treasurer.</p>

The state engineer shall forthwith fix permanent marks in each
end of the Hoosac Tunnel, marking the progress of the work up to

to determine the value of any work, or materials delivered subsequent
to the date last named. He shall monthly, immediately after the first
day of each month, estimate the proportion which the work done upon

masonry, bridging and superstructure of the unfinished portion of the
road east of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The scrip shall be delivered on the road in the proportion which the
value of the work done and the materials delivered each month bears
to the estimated cost of the whole work and materials required on the
portion of road aforesaid.</p>

<p>No expenditures shall be required merely for the purposes of ornament,
but the work shall be substantially performed, and the rails shall
weigh not less than fifty-six pounds to the lineal yard; for any defective
materials or work, a proportionate amount of scrip shall be withheld.</p>

work, and for that purpose shall visit and inspect the same at least once
in each year, and as much oftener as they may deem expedient; and

treasurer shall thereupon deliver the amount of scrip so certified for, to
the treasurer of the Troy and Greenfield Railroad Company, or to his
order, subject to the provisions hereafter mentioned. If he shall not
approve thereof he shall submit the same to the council, and their
approval transmitted to the state treasurer as aforesaid shall authorize

<p class="center"><i>Statement of J. W. Brooks, Esq., Chairman of the Commissioners,
made to the Committee during the session of the
Legislature, 1866.</i></p>

<p>The first Act for loaning the credit of the State to the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad Company, dated April 5, 1854, provides, besides
other conditions, that when seven miles of the road in one or two sections
is completed, and 1,000 feet of the tunnel, in one or more sections,
sufficient for one or more tracks is completed, then $100,000 of scrip
shall be delivered to the company.</p>

<p>The size of the tunnel required by this Act is not definitely stated,
nor what proportion of the $100,000 of scrip is loaned on account of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>The Act of April 4, 1860, defines the size the tunnel to be 14 feet
wide and 18 feet high. If this means excavation and not completed
tunnel, then the room required for the ballast and drainage would reduce
the height to about 16 feet above the rails; a size absurdly small
enough to be regarded as certainly not above the minimum intended by
the Act. The same Act provides that $30 per foot shall be allowed on
account of heading, and $20 on account of the enlargement, making $50
per foot for the completed tunnel; $50,000 of the first advance may
therefore be considered as on account of the first 1,000 feet of completed
tunnel, and the remainder, say $50,000, on account of the road
which had been then completed west of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The second delivery of scrip was on account of the tunnel, and
under the provisions of the' Act of 1859, which provides that $50,000
may be advanced upon the completion of 1,000 feet of heading. The
heading was done and $49,777.78 delivered October 4, 1859.</p>

<p>The third delivery of scrip was under the provisions of the same Act,
and was on account of grading three miles of road, in detached pieces,
near Greenfield. For this, $50,222.22 was delivered January 3, 1860.</p>

<p>The fourth delivery was under the same Act, and for completing the
second 1,000 feet of tunnel, for which $30,222.22, was delivered March
1, 1860.</p>

<p>An Act changing the terms of the loan was passed April 4, 1860.
Section 2 divides the scrip remaining undelivered, as follows: "No further
deliveries of scrip shall be made to said company upon the conditions
authorized in former Acts, but the undelivered portions of the
loan of two millions of dollars authorized by chapter two hundred and
twenty-six of the Acts of eighteen hundred and fifty-four, amounting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
one million seven hundred and seventy thousand dollars, shall be
divided and apportioned between the railroad and tunnel, and for the
construction of each, respectively: 'six hundred and fifty thousand dollars
for the completion of the unfinished portion of railroad extending
from the eastern terminus of said road near Greenfield, to within half
a mile of the eastern end of Hoosac Tunnel."</p>

<p>Section 3 contains the following provisions: "The governor and
council shall annually appoint a state engineer for the purpose of examining
and determining monthly the amount and value of the work done,
and materials delivered on the railroad and tunnel of the Troy and
Greenfield Railroad Company, who shall receive an annual salary of
one thousand dollars, payable quarterly. The state engineer shall
forthwith fix permanent marks in each end of the Hoosac Tunnel,
marking the progress of the work up to February twenty-fourth,
eighteen hundred and sixty, from which to determine the progress
subsequently made. He shall also determine by suitable notes, marks
or observations, the amount and value of all grading, bridging, masonry,
or other work done, or iron, or other materials delivered on the road
east of the Hoosac Tunnel, prior to December twenty-second, eighteen
hundred and fifty-nine, and fix data from which to determine the value
of any work, or materials delivered subsequent to the date last named.
He shall monthly, immediately after the first day of each month, estimate
the proportion which' the work done upon the road, since the preceding
estimate, bears to the whole of the work required to be done in
the graduation, masonry, bridging, and superstructure of said railroad
east of the Hoosac Tunnel; and also the work done in the excavation of
said tunnel, which he shall certify separately to the governor, together
with the amount of state scrip to which the company is entitled under
the provisions of this Act. Such monthly estimates shall be based upon
a width of road-bed at grade of fifteen feet, on embankments, seventeen
and a half feet in side cuts, and twenty feet in through cuts; in the
heading of the tunnel upon dimensions fourteen feet wide and six feet
high in the middle, and in the finished excavation of the tunnel of
fourteen feet wide and eighteen feet high in the middle.</p>

<p>"The deliveries of scrip shall be at the rate of fifty dollars for each
lineal foot of tunnel, divided between heading and full-sized tunnel, in
the proportion of thirty dollars for each lineal foot of heading and
twenty dollars per lineal foot for the remaining excavation; and of six
hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the whole of the graduation,
masonry, bridging, and superstructure of the unfinished portion of the
road east of the tunnel.</p>

<p>"The Scrip shall be delivered on the road in the proportion which the
value of the work done and the materials delivered each month bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the estimated cost of the whole work and materials required on the
portion of road aforesaid.</p>

<p>"No expenditures shall be required merely for the purposes of ornament,
but the work shall be substantially performed, and the rails shall
weigh not less than fifty-six pounds to the lineal yard; for any defective
materials or work, a proportionate amount of scrip shall be withheld.</p>

<p>"The governor and council shall have a general supervision of the
work, and for that purpose shall visit and inspect the same at least
once in each year, and as much oftener as they may deem expedient;
and they shall have power to correct abuses, remedy defects, and enforce
requirements, by withholding scrip or imposing new requirements in
such manner as the interest of the Commonwealth shall in their
judgment require."</p>

<p>Under the provisions of this Act scrip to the amount of $455,034.70
has been delivered on account of the railroad and $40,131.95 on account
of the tunnel.</p>

<p>State scrip was delivered in sterling up to and including the delivery
of March 7, 1861, and afterwards in dollar bonds. In this statement
the sterling is changed into dollars, to show it all in one currency, and
the pound sterling is reckoned, as by the State treasurer when the
deliveries were made, at $4.44<sup>44</sup>/<sub>100</sub>.</p>

<p>The certificates for amounts due on account of the railroad or tunnel
were for irregular sums, and the scrip delivered was in round amounts;
the fractional difference sometimes in excess and sometimes below the
amount of the certificates is divided between the tunnel and railroad
in proportion to the amount due on account of each.</p>

<p>Stated and divided as above, the scrip which has been delivered on
account of the railroad and tunnel, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The amount of State scrip which according to statutes, had been
earned by the progress made towards constructing the tunnel before the
surrender of the property to the State, may be stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Strictly considered, no portion of the tunnel at the East End was cut
to the required size of 14 feet wide and 18 feet high, much of it was less
than 12 feet wide, and some of it only about 13 feet high. At the
entrance the excavation was so nearly sufficient that only a small
amount more was required to bring it to full size, and had all the rest
been well done, a not very exacting inspector might have passed 25 feet
of this as completed. The remaining 2,964 feet of penetration at this
end could form no ground whatever for a claim as completed work.</p>

<p>At the West Shaft the heading had been driven in both directions
56<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet.</p>

<p>At the West End the total penetration had been 543 feet. Of this
distance 26 feet had been arched with stone&mdash;40 feet is in rock, standing
without support, and 477 feet is temporarily supported with timbers.
Under the assumption that the 40 feet left unsupported is safe enough
to be left permanently 80, then 66 feet was completed at this end, giving
at all points a total penetration of 3,588<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet, of which, 91 feet was
completed.</p>

<p>It is clear that the payment of $50,000, under the Act of April 5,
1854, for 1,000 feet of completed tunnel, was not earned.</p>

<p>Under the Act of 1859, scrip to the amount of $50,000 was to be
delivered upon the completion of 1,000 feet of heading, and though the
prior conditions of this Act had not been complied with, this amount
may fairly be considered as having been earned.</p>

<p>The next payment of $30,222.22 for the completion of the second
1,000 feet of tunnel was clearly not earned.</p>

<p>All subsequent payments were made under the Act of April 4, 1860,
providing for the payment of $30 per foot for heading and $20 per foot
for the enlargement.</p>

<p>The total amount according to the several Acts is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first payment of $50,000 under the Act of 1854, should have
been for seven miles of completed railroad. The certificate of the
engineer, upon which it was paid, gave (see page 82 of House document
No. 185 for 1860,) the length of rails laid as upwards of seven
miles; nothing in the certificate showed then any part of it was completed
road, and upon investigation then made it proved that while most
of it was done, a part near the west end of the tunnel "was not ten feet
wide," and would cost several thousand dollars to complete it. It is
clear that this payment had not then been earned in the manner
provided by the statute.</p>

<p>The second payment was on account of the road, under the Act of
1859, for grading three miles of road, "said three miles being all
situated within four miles of the point of commencement;" Page 30 of
House document No. 185 for 1860 says of this grading, "the continuous
line is interrupted by fourteen gaps of cuts and fills;" it is thus made
up of fifteen separate pieces, avoiding all but the cheapest part of the
work, and costing, as the contractor who did the work certifies, between
$8,000 and $9,000. Under, to say the least, a somewhat liberal construction
of the Act, $50,000 was said to have been earned by doing this grading.</p>

the column. Spelling was standardized to the most prevalent form.
Punctuation was left as printed.</p>

<p>On page 42 the curve value 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&deg; was changed to
3&deg; 30' to match the other similar values. The sum of the shares in the
table in Appendix A on pages 50-51 should total 4,610 shares but was
printed as 0,000. This was assumed to be a typographical error.</p>
